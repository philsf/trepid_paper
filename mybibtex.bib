                   the development of insect control by genetic
                   manipulation. These methods include the sterile-male
                   technique, now well known, which depends on ionizing
                   radiation or chemosterilization. The recent field
                   experiment carried out by WHO in Rangoon, Burma, on
                   Culex fatigans has demonstrated that naturally
                   occurring cytogenetic mechanisms such as cytoplasmic
                   incompatibility can be used successfully without the
                   use of radiations or chemosterilants. The paper not
                   only describes the experiment on Culex fatigans but
                   also discusses basic concepts and theoretical
                   considerations involved in genetic control of insects
                   of public health importance. The possibility of using
                   genetic mechanisms for the control of other vector
                   species is also discussed. There are a number of
                   problems which require study before genetic control can
                   be used on an operational scale. These problems and
                   suggestions for future research in this field are also

  abstract       = {(1) The stability criteria of a single-species
                   population with a maintained food supply depend on the
                   relationship between the characteristic return time
                   (TR) and the time delays of the system. TR expresses
                   the rate at which the population approaches the
                   equilibrium and the time delays may refer either to
                   generation time or extrinsic delays as may be
                   associated with a resource recovery time. (2) For a
                   single age-class population with discrete generations
                   where b is the slope of the density-dependent
                   relationship between mortality or survival (as a
                   k-value) and log population density, the characteristic
                   return time is 1/b. The time delay in this case is the
                   generation time (tau = 1). The population damps
                   exponentially (undercompensates) if TR is greater than
                   tau but becomes increasingly unstable (overcompensates)
                   as TR falls below tau. (3) The continuous
                   (differential) analogue of this discrete single age
                   class example is the Gompertz equation. By including in
                   this an explicit time delay (T), the stability
                   properties become very similar to the discrete case.
                   (4) General models for the discrete and continuous
                   cases are discussed. They further emphasize that a
                   general requirement for stability is that the
                   characteristic return time TR be larger than the time
                   delays (tau or T). (5) Different models for density
                   dependence are reviewed with special emphasis on
                   distinguishing the linear from non-linear models in log
                   population units. The linear models, which are adequate
                   in the neighbourhood of equilibrium, give a misleading
                   impression of the global stability properties. They
                   predict ever expanding oscillations when there is very
                   strong density-dependence (b>2). Only the non-linear
                   models permit stable limit cycles under these
                   conditions. (6) The stability properties of populations
                   when more than one age class is present at one time are
                   more complicated and in many ways are similar to those
                   of multi-species systems. The single parameter b is
                   replaced by a matrix of parameters characterizing the
                   slopes of the density dependent relationships between
                   age classes. The stability of the population in the
                   neighbourhood of the equilibrium is then set by the
                   dominant eigenvalue of this matrix.},

  abstract       = {(1) A variety of data on field and laboratory
                   populations is reviewed in which there is little or no
                   overlap between generations. These data are then fitted
                   to a simple, non-linear, density dependent population
                   model. (2) A rich spectrum of dynamical behaviour is
                   possible in such a non-linear model (ranging from a
                   stable equilibrium point, through stable cycles, to
                   apparently chaotic population fluctuations). In the
                   particular model discussed, these stability properties
                   hinge upon two parameters. These have been estimated
                   for a variety of insect populations enabling us to
                   compare the dynamical behaviour of real populations
                   with that which is theoretically possible. (3) We find
                   the majority of populations show a monotonic return to
                   a stable equilibrium point following a disturbance,
                   with relatively few examples of oscillatory damping or
                   low-order limit cycles. (4) Examples of stable cyclic
                   behaviour, or of chaotic fluctuations, are mostly found
                   in laboratory populations. In such cases, the absence
                   of many natural mortality factors, or of dispersal, may
                   tend to exaggerate non-linear aspects of the dynamics.
                   (5) The observed range of fluctuations in various
                   populations is tabulated. These are discussed in
                   relation to the predicted ranges of fluctuation where
                   limit cycles or chaos occur. The conclusion supports
                   that of (3) above; namely that most natural populations
                   will tend to return to a stable equilibrium point
                   following a disturbance.},

                   estimate evolutionary distances in terms of the number
                   of nucleotide substitutions (and, also, the
                   evolutionary rates when the divergence times are
                   known). In comparing a pair of nucleotide sequences, we
                   distinguish two types of differences; if homologous
                   sites are occupied by different nucleotide bases but
                   both are purines or both pyrimidines, the difference is
                   called type I (or "transition" type), while, if one of
                   the two is a purine and the other is a pyrimidine, the
                   difference is called type II (or "transversion" type).
                   Letting P and Q be respectively the fractions of
                   nucleotide sites showing type I and type II differences
                   between two sequences compared, then the evolutionary
                   distance per site is K = -(1/2) ln [(1-2P-Q) square
                   root of 1-2Q]. The evolutionary rate per year is then
                   given by k = K/(2T), where T is the time since the
                   divergence of the two sequences. If only the third
                   codon positions are compared, the synonymous component
                   of the evolutionary base substitutions per site is
                   estimated by K'S = -(1/2) ln (1-2P-Q). Also, formulae
                   for standard errors were obtained. Some examples were
                   worked out using reported globin sequences to show that
                   synonymous substitutions occur at much higher rates
                   than amino acid-altering substitutions in evolution.},

                   account effectively the information contained in a set
                   of DNA sequence data. The molecular clock of
                   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was calibrated by setting the
                   date of divergence between primates and ungulates at
                   the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million years
                   ago), when the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A
                   generalized least-squares method was applied in fitting
                   a model to mtDNA sequence data, and the clock gave
                   dates of 92.3 +/- 11.7, 13.3 +/- 1.5, 10.9 +/- 1.2, 3.7
                   +/- 0.6, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 million years ago (where the
                   second of each pair of numbers is the standard
                   deviation) for the separation of mouse, gibbon,
                   orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively, from
                   the line leading to humans. Although there is some
                   uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a
                   problem for the widely believed hypothesis that the
                   pipedal creature Australopithecus afarensis, which
                   lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli in Tanzania
                   and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man and
                   evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier
                   possibility is that mtDNA was transferred through
                   hybridization between a proto-human and a
                   proto-chimpanzee after the former had developed
                   bipedalism.},

                   two molecular probes derived from internal regions of a
                   full-sized P element. Strains that had been collected
                   from several continents at varying times during the
                   past 60 years were examined. The oldest available
                   strains, representing most major geographical regions
                   of the world, exhibited no detectable hybridization to
                   the P-element probes. In contrast, all recently
                   collected natural populations that were tested carried
                   P-element sequences. The earliest appearance of P
                   elements occurred in collections made during the 1950s
                   and early 1960s in the Americas and during the late
                   1960s on other continents. The youngest strains that
                   were completely devoid of P elements originated in
                   populations sampled during the mid-1960s in America,
                   but as late as 1974 in populations from the USSR. There
                   are differences in the patterns of hybridization to the
                   two P-element probes between populations from different

                   with the varying P-M phenotypic properties of these
                   populations. Taken together with the results of
                   phenotypic tests reported in earlier studies, the
                   available evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of
                   a worldwide P-element invasion of D. melanogaster
                   during the past 30 years and suggests that the putative

                   fundamental equations of the general model, with 12
                   independent substitution parameters, are used to obtain
                   a formula which corrects the effect of multiple and
                   parallel substitutions on the measure of evolutionary
                   divergence between two homologous sequences. We show
                   that only reversible models, with six independent
                   parameters, allow the calculation of the substitution
                   rates. Simulation experiments on DNA sequence evolution

                   estimated transposition rates of some Drosophila mobile

                   spontaneous mutations have been accumulated
                   independently for about 400 generations. Occupied sites
                   of the mobile elements were detected by in situ
                   hybridization on the salivary gland chromosomes sampled
                   from 40 AW and 30 JH lines. The rates of insertion and
                   excision of the copia and two copia-like elements, 412
                   and 17.6, are very low: Insertions occurred at up to
                   10(-3) per second chromosome per generation (17.6) and
                   excision occurred at about 10(-5) per site per

                   density dependent growth equation to examine the
                   critical parameter values that determine whether or not
                   a mobile element will spread and become fixed in a
                   finite diploid vector population. Populations were
                   simulated with parameter values affecting size,
                   reproductive rate, density-dependence, and
                   transposition efficiency of the mobile element.
                   Simulations indicated that an equilibrium was reached
                   quickly, typically in < 50 generations. Even when
                   initially present at < or = 1% of a large population,
                   the mobile element spread quickly and became fixed if
                   transposition efficiency was equal to unity and
                   infertility caused by the element decreased
                   reproductive capacity by as much as 45%. These results
                   were insensitive to the values of basic wild type
                   reproductive rates and density dependence, but
                   population size, transposition efficiency of the

                   initial ratio of TE-bearing to wild individuals
                   modified the outcome. As population size and
                   transposition efficiency decreased in value, TEs became
                   fixed less easily. However, even in populations as
                   small as n = 100, an element with a transposition
                   efficiency > 0.75 that reduces fertility < 25% will
                   become fixed when introduced at a frequency as low as
                   1% of the total population. These results are
                   consistent with previously reported population genetics
                   models. They suggest that engineered transposons with a
                   wide range of properties may be used to drive genes,
                   such as those for parasite resistance, into wild vector

                   change in the way that modelling Is being done in
                   ecology. First, the theory of chaos tells us that
                   short-term predictions of nonlinear systems will be
                   difficult, and long-term predictions will be
                   impossible. The grave Implications this has for ecology
                   are only just beginning to be understood. Second,
                   ecologists have started to recognize the importance of
                   local interactions between individuals in ecological
                   systems. And third, improvements in computer power and
                   software are making computers more inviting as a
                   primary tool for modelling. The combination of these
                   factors may have far-reaching consequences for
                   ecological theory.},

                   on Ishigaki Island the chromosomal distribution of

                   hybridization. In this population the cosmopolitan
                   inversion, In(2L)t, is known to exist in high
                   frequency. One major haplotype concerning the occupied
                   sites of the transposable elements was identified in
                   the In(2L)t-carrying chromosomes. This haplotype is
                   suggested to be the ancestral one. The age of the
                   inversion in this local population was estimated to be
                   1,400 generations. The transposition rates of these

                   were similar each other in the copia-like elements as
                   well as in the LINE-like elements. The rate was higher
                   in the copia-like elements than in the LINE-like
                   elements. Insertions occurred in the range from 6.79 x

                   is herein shown that both insertions and excisions
                   occurred at a significantly higher rate in this

                   (TrEs) in both solanaceous plants and Caenorhabditis
                   elegans have been identified by screening the DNA data
                   base for inverted repeated domains present in multiple
                   copies in the genome. The elements are localized within
                   intron and flanking regions of many genes. These
                   elements consist of two inverted repeats flanking
                   sequences ranging from 5 bp to > 500 bp. Identification
                   of multiple elements in which sequence conservation
                   includes both the flanking and internal regions implies
                   that these TrEs are capable of duplicative
                   transposition. Two of the elements were identified in
                   promoter regions of the tomato (Lycoperiscon
                   esculentum) polygalacturonase and potato (Solanum
                   tuberosum) Win1 genes. The element in the
                   polygalacturonase promoter spans a known regulatory
                   region. In both cases, ancestral DNA sequences, which
                   represent potential recombination target sequences
                   prior to insertion of the elements, have been cloned
                   from related species. The sequences of the inverted
                   repeated domains in plants and C. elegans show a high
                   degree of phylogenetic conservation. While frequency of
                   the different elements is variable, some are present in
                   very high copy number. A member of a single C. elegans
                   TrE family is observed approximately once every 20 kb
                   in the genome. The abundance of the described TrEs
                   suggests utility in the genomic analysis of these and

                   nucleotides and among different nucleotide sites in
                   mitochondrial protein-coding genes of vertebrates. In
                   the 1st + 2nd codon position data, the frequency of
                   nucleotide G is negatively correlated with evolutionary
                   rates of genes, substitution rates vary substantially
                   among sites, and the transition/transversion rate bias
                   (R) is two to five times larger than that expected at
                   random. Generally, largest transition biases and
                   greatest differences in substitution rates among sites
                   are found in the highly conserved genes. The 3rd
                   positions in placental mammal genes exhibit strong
                   nucleotide composition biases and the transitional
                   rates exceed transversional rates by one to two orders
                   of magnitude. Tamura-Nei and Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano
                   models with gamma distributed variable rates among
                   sites (gamma parameter, alpha) adequately describe the
                   nucleotide substitution process in 1st+2nd position
                   data. In these data, ignoring differences in
                   substitution rates among sites leads to largest biases
                   while estimating substitution rates. Kimura's
                   two-parameter model with variable-rates among sites
                   performs satisfactorily in likelihood estimation of R,
                   alpha, and overall amount of evolution for 1st+2nd
                   position data. It can also be used to estimate pairwise
                   distances with appropriate values of alpha for a
                   majority of genes.},

                   in Drosophila. All putative Drosophila pseudogenes show
                   patterns of molecular evolution that are inconsistent
                   with the lack of functional constraints. The absence of
                   bona fide pseudogenes is not only puzzling, it also
                   hampers attempts to estimate rates and patterns of
                   neutral DNA change. The estimation problem is
                   especially acute in the case of deletions and
                   insertions, which are likely to have large effects when
                   they occur in functional genes and are therefore
                   subject to strong purifying selection. We propose a
                   solution to this problem by taking advantage of the
                   propensity of retrotransposable elements without long
                   terminal repeats (non-LTR) to create non-functional,
                   'dead-on-arrival' copies of themselves as a common
                   by-product of their transpositional cycle. Phylogenetic
                   analysis of a non-LTR element, Helena, demonstrates
                   that copies lose DNA at an unusually high rate,
                   suggesting that lack of pseudogenes in Drosophila is
                   the product of rampant deletion of DNA in unconstrained
                   regions. This finding has important implications for
                   the study of genome evolution in general and the
                   'C-value paradox' in particular.},

                   transposable elements. In an attempt to understand the
                   evolutionary dynamics of the P element family, an
                   extensive phylogenetic analysis of 239 partial P
                   element sequences has been completed. These sequences
                   were obtained from 40 species in the Drosophila
                   subgenus Sophophora. The phylogeny of the P element
                   family is examined in the context of a phylogeny of the
                   species in which these elements are found. An
                   interesting feature of many of the species examined is
                   the coexistence in the same genome of P sequences
                   belonging to two or more divergent subfamilies. In
                   general, P elements in Drosophila have been transmitted
                   vertically from generation to generation over
                   evolutionary time. However, four unequivocal cases of
                   horizontal transfer, in which the element was
                   transferred between species, have been identified. In
                   addition, the P element phylogeny is best explained in
                   numerous instances by horizontal transfer at various
                   times in the past. These observations suggest that, as
                   with some other transposable elements, horizontal
                   transfer may play an important role in the maintenance

                   driving the ry+ allele into populations homozygous for
                   a ry- allele at the genomic rosy locus. Transformed
                   flies were introduced at 1%, 5%, and 10% starting
                   frequencies to establish a series of populations that
                   were monitored over the course of 40 generations, using
                   both phenotypic and molecular assays. The
                   transposon-borne ry+ marker allele spread rapidly in

                   modules (e.g. transcription factor binding sites,
                   secondary structure elements, repeats) arranged in
                   distinct patterns. Recognition of such patterns is
                   essential for identification of promoters in non-coding
                   sequences. However, this is difficult due to the
                   absence of overall sequence similarity in promoters
                   even if they are regulated in a similar way. We
                   implemented simple formal representations of general
                   features of regulatory regions into an algorithm
                   capable of developing complex models reflecting both
                   the element composition and the functional organization
                   of individual elements (ModelGenerator). Though
                   ModelGenerator requires a very simple initial model
                   (e.g. two modules and their relative order) it will
                   generate a much more sophisticated model by analysis of
                   the training set of at least ten sequences. We show
                   ModelGenerator to successfully model different
                   retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) classes
                   (Lentivirus as well as avian and mammalian C-type)
                   which contain functional promoters. Database searches
                   with the program ModelInspector demonstrated the high
                   specificity of these models and no apparent false
                   negatives were detected. We also verified one match
                   from GenBank to the mammalian C-type LTR model
                   experimentally and showed this sequence to contain an
                   active promoter. Thus, the concept of modular
                   organization of functional regulatory DNA regions (e.g.
                   promoters) could be successfully implemented into a set
                   of computer tools which might be flexible and specific
                   enough to be suitable for prospective analysis of new

                   variety and distribution of transposable elements (TEs)
                   in natural populations. There is little doubt that TEs
                   provide new genetic variation on a scale, and with a
                   degree of sophistication, previously unimagined. There
                   are many examples of mutations and other types of
                   genetic variation associated with the activity of
                   mobile elements. Mutant phenotypes range from subtle
                   changes in tissue specificity to dramatic alterations
                   in the development and organization of tissues and
                   organs. Such changes can occur because of insertions in
                   coding regions, but the more sophisticated TE-mediated
                   changes are more often the result of insertions into 5'
                   flanking regions and introns. Here, TE-induced
                   variation is viewed from three evolutionary
                   perspectives that are not mutually exclusive. First,
                   variation resulting from the intrinsic parasitic nature
                   of TE activity is examined. Second, we describe
                   possible coadaptations between elements and their hosts
                   that appear to have evolved because of selection to
                   reduce the deleterious effects of new insertions on
                   host fitness. Finally, some possible cases are explored
                   in which the capacity of TEs to generate variation has
                   been exploited by their hosts. The number of well
                   documented cases in which element sequences appear to
                   confer useful traits on the host, although small, is
                   growing rapidly.},

                   estimating neutral rates and patterns of spontaneous
                   mutation (Petrov et al., 1996). This method takes
                   advantage of the propensity of non-LTR
                   retrotransposable elements to create non-functional,
                   'dead-on-arrival' copies as a product of transposition.
                   Maximum parsimony analysis is used to separate the
                   evolution of actively transposing lineages of a non-LTR
                   element from the fate of individual inactive
                   insertions, and thereby allows one to assess directly
                   the relative rates of different types of mutation,
                   including point substitutions, deletions and
                   insertions. Because non-LTR elements enjoy wide
                   phylogenetic distribution, this method can be used in
                   taxa that do not harbor a significant number of bona
                   fide pseudogenes, as is the case in Drosophila (Jeffs
                   and Ashburner, 1991; Weiner et al., 1986). We used this
                   method with Helena, a non-LTR retrotransposable element
                   present in the Drosophila virilis species group. A
                   striking finding was the virtual absence of insertions
                   and remarkably high incidence of large deletions, which
                   combine to produce a high overall rate of DNA loss. On
                   average, the rate of DNA loss in D. virilis is
                   approximately 75 times faster than that estimated for
                   mammalian pseudogenes (Petrov et al., 1996). The high
                   rate of DNA loss should lead to rapid elimination of
                   non-essential DNA and thus may explain the seemingly
                   paradoxical dearth of pseudogenes in Drosophila.
                   Varying rates of DNA loss may also contribute to
                   differences in genome size (Graur et al., 1989; Petrov
                   et al., 1996), thus explaining the celebrated 'C-value'
                   paradox (John and Miklos, 1988). In this paper we
                   outline the theoretical basis of our method, examine
                   the data from this perspective, and discuss potential
                   problems that may bias our estimates.},

                   considerable theoretical and empirical interest. Under
                   simple models, copy numbers may increase without limit.
                   Mechanisms that can prevent such an increase include
                   those in which the effect of selection increases with
                   copy number, those in which the rate of transposition
                   decreases with copy number, and those where unlimited
                   increase in copy number is prevented by the
                   consequences of functional heterogeneity in the
                   transposable element family. Finite population sizes
                   may attenuate the power of natural selection to act on
                   transposable element copy number in a number of ways
                   that may be of particular importance in laboratory
                   populations. First, a small host population size will
                   create occasional periods in which the variance between
                   individuals in copy number is diminished, and with it
                   the power of natural selection, even when the expected
                   variance is Poisson. Second, small population sizes
                   will produce high-frequency transposable element sites,
                   systematically reducing the variance in copy number.
                   The consequences will be particularly profound when the
                   selective damage of transposable elements follows from
                   their heterozygosity, as when ectopic exchange limits
                   copy number.},

                   copia were directly measured in males and females of an
                   inbred Drosophila melanogaster line, 2b3, which is
                   highly polymorphic for copia insertion sites. The
                   elevated germ line transposition rate of copia in this
                   line (3-8 x 10(-3) per generation per element) is
                   confined to males, with transposition in females being
                   undetectable under the conditions of the experiment but
                   at most 50-fold lower than the rate for males. To
                   determine the molecular basis of this effect, copia RNA
                   levels were measured in whole bodies and germ lines of
                   male and female flies of both the unstable 2b3 line and
                   a stable line, Oregon RC-iso, which shows normal rates
                   of copia transposition. Both male and female 2b3 flies
                   contain much more copia RNA than flies of the stable
                   line. However, 2b3 male germinal tissues contain much
                   higher levels of copia RNA than the equivalent female
                   tissues. The highest copia expression is detected in
                   maturing primary spermatocytes. Our data show that high
                   rates of germ line copia transposition are restricted
                   to males by tissue-specific control of RNA levels and
                   suggest that transposition of copia only occurs in fly

                   element has invaded the Drosophila melanogaster genome
                   after a horizontal transfer from the phylogenetically
                   distant species Drosophila willistoni. The differences
                   between P element phylogeny and that of the Drosophila
                   genus could in part be explained by horizontal
                   transfers. In vivo experiments show that P elements are
                   able to transpose in the genomes of other Drosophila
                   species. This suggests that horizontal transmission of
                   P elements could have taken place in many species of
                   this genus. The regulation, transposition, and
                   deleterious effects of the P element in D. melanogaster
                   were formalized and integrated in a global model to
                   produce a simulation program that simulates a P element
                   invasion. The simulations show that our knowledge of
                   the P element in D. melanogaster can explain its
                   behavior in the Drosophila genus. The equilibrium state
                   of the invaded population of a new species depends on
                   its ability to repair damage caused by P element
                   activity. If repair is efficient, the equilibrium state
                   tends to be of the P type state, in which case the
                   element could subsequently invade other populations of
                   the species. Conversely, the equilibrium state is of
                   the M' type state when the ability to repair damage is
                   low. The invasion of the P element into other
                   populations of this new species can then only occur by
                   genetic drift and it is likely to be lost. The success
                   of a P element invasion into a new species thus greatly
                   depends on its ability to produce dysgenic crosses.},

                   a model of {P} element invasion in {D}rosophila.},

  abstract       = {Work on how transposable elements are maintained and
                   spread by virtue of their transposition processes have
                   produced many theoretical studies of their evolutionary
                   dynamics. But recent studies, which have experimentally
                   identified some of these mechanisms, have not been
                   taken into account. We present an integrated model of P
                   transposable element regulation. It includes, at an
                   individual level, the various mechanisms of regulation
                   and the transposition events, that have been
                   experimentally identified, recording specifically the
                   chromosomal localisations of the inserted copies. It
                   attempts to define the minimum conditions for
                   explaining the regulation and spread of the P
                   transposable element in Drosophila melanogaster natural
                   populations. One test of this model is that it must
                   explain the different population states found in the
                   wild. A program that simulates the changes in
                   Drosophila populations during the invasion of P
                   elements was developed; the simulated populations were
                   then compared to natural population data at the
                   molecular and genetic levels. The model was validated
                   by testing the dynamics of P element invasion in
                   populations. It could explain the different natural
                   population states with a recurrent invasion process.
                   The simulations show that migration reduces the total
                   number of copies, increases the number of defective
                   copies, decreases P-activity and increases
                   P-susceptibility, shifting equilibrium states from P to
                   M'. They also show that the copies determining
                   P-cytotype regulation spread faster by selection when
                   located on the X chromosome. This result could account
                   for the unexplained accumulation of P copies on the X
                   chromosomes of some natural populations. Moreover the
                   simulations predict a novel equilibrium state, called
                   P', not yet characterized in natural populations but
                   that can be found in natural population data.},

                   of transposition and copy number in the genome for the
                   copia and Doc retrotransposons of Drosophila
                   melanogaster. copia and Doc transposition rates were
                   directly measured in sublines of the isogenic 2b line
                   using individual males or females, respectively, with a
                   range of copia copy numbers from 49 to 103 and Doc copy
                   numbers from 112 to 235 per genome. Transposition rates
                   varied from 3 x 10(-4) to 2 x 10(-2) for copia and from
                   2 x 10(-4) to 2 x 10(-3) for Doc. A positive
                   relationship between transposition rate and copy number
                   was found both for copia and for Doc when the data were
                   analysed across all the 2b individuals; no significant
                   correlation was found when the data were analysed
                   across the subline means for both retrotransposons
                   tested. Overall, correlation between copia and Doc
                   transposition rate and their copy number in the genome,
                   if any, was not negative, which would be expected if
                   transposable elements (TEs) self-regulate their copy
                   number. Thus, for copia and Doc no evidence for
                   self-regulation was provided, and at least for these
                   two TEs this hypothesis is not favoured for explaining
                   the maintenance of the stable copy number that is
                   characteristic for natural populations. The
                   transposition rate of copia was measured twice, and a
                   strong positive correlation between copy number and
                   transposition rate both across individuals and subline
                   means was found in 1994, while in 1995 no correlation
                   was found. This fact is in agreement with the
                   hypothesis that a positive correlation between the rate
                   of transposition and TE copy number may be a default
                   starting point for future host-TE coevolution.},

                   provides a balanced presentation of theory and
                   observation for students at the undergraduate and
                   graduate levels. In response to suggestions from
                   students and instructors, the book has been trimmed
                   more than 100 pages and rewritten with the goal to
                   optimize its use as a teaching aid. It introduces the
                   principles of genetics and statistics that are relevant
                   to population studies, and examines the forces
                   affecting genetic variation from the molecular to the
                   organismic level. Integrated throughout the book are
                   descriptions of molecular methods used to study
                   variation in natural populations, as well as
                   explanations of the relevant estimation theory using
                   actual data. Chapter 1 presents the fundamental genetic
                   and statistical concepts in population genetics.
                   Chapter 2 reviews the types and prevalence of genetic
                   variation in natural populations. This is followed in
                   Chapter 3 by a detailed examination of the implications
                   of random mating for one locus and multiple loci.
                   Chapter 4 examines population subdivision and its
                   consequences for the distribution of genetic variation
                   among subpopulations, including the hierarchical F
                   statistics used in estimating these effects. Chapters 5
                   through 7 deal with mutation, migration, natural
                   selection in all its varieties, and the consequences of
                   random genetic drift. Molecular population genetics,
                   including coalescent theory, is the subject of Chapter
                   8. Quantitative genetics is covered in Chapter 9, from
                   the standpoint of genetic variance and covariance
                   components as well as with respect to molecular markers
                   used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
                   Applications of principles discussed in the text are
                   illustrated by numerous examples of worked problems,
                   using actual data. Each chapter end, in addition to a
                   complete summary, offers several problems for solution,
                   to reinforce and further develop the concepts.},

  abstract       = {We recently proposed that patterns of evolution of
                   non-LTR retrotransposable elements can be used to study
                   patterns of spontaneous mutation. Transposition of
                   non-LTR retrotransposable elements commonly results in
                   creation of 5' truncated, "dead-on-arrival" copies.
                   These inactive copies are effectively pseudogenes and,
                   according to the neutral theory, their molecular
                   evolution ought to reflect rates and patterns of
                   spontaneous mutation. Maximum parsimony can be used to
                   separate the evolution of active lineages of a non-LTR
                   element from the fate of the "dead-on-arrival"
                   insertions and to directly assess the relative
                   frequencies of different types of spontaneous
                   mutations. We applied this approach using a non-LTR
                   element, Helena, in the Drosophila virilis group and
                   have demonstrated a surprisingly high incidence of
                   large deletions and the virtual absence of insertions.
                   Based on these results, we suggested that Drosophila in
                   general may exhibit a high rate of spontaneous large
                   deletions and have hypothesized that such a high rate
                   of DNA loss may help to explain the puzzling dearth of
                   bona fide pseudogenes in Drosophila. We also speculated
                   that variation in the rate of spontaneous deletion may
                   contribute to the divergence of genome size in
                   different taxa by affecting the amount of superfluous
                   "junk" DNA such as, for example, pseudogenes or long
                   introns. In this paper, we extend our analysis to the
                   D. melanogaster subgroup, which last shared a common
                   ancestor with the D. virilis group approximately 40
                   MYA. In a different region of the same transposable
                   element, Helena, we demonstrate that inactive copies
                   accumulate deletions in species of the D. melanogaster
                   subgroup at a rate very similar to that of the D.
                   virilis group. These results strongly suggest that the
                   high rate of DNA loss is a general feature of
                   Drosophila and not a peculiar property of a particular
                   stretch of DNA in a particular species group.},

  abstract       = {Transposable elements (TEs) are sequences capable of
                   multiplying in their host's genome. They survive by
                   increasing copy numbers due to transpositions, and
                   natural selection washes them out because hosts with
                   heavier loads of TEs have lower fitness. The available
                   phylogenetic evidence supports the view that TEs have
                   existed in living organisms for hundreds of millions of
                   years. A fundamental question facing the field is how
                   can an equilibrium be attained between transposition
                   and selection which allows these parasitic genetic
                   elements to persist for such a long time period? To
                   answer this question, it is necessary to understand how
                   the rate of TE transposition is controlled and to
                   describe the mechanisms with which natural selection
                   opposes TE accumulation. Perhaps the best models for
                   such a study are copia and gypsy retrotransposons in
                   Drosophila. Their average rate of transposition in
                   nature is between 10(-5) - 10(-4) transpositions per
                   copy per generation. Unlike nature, transposition rates
                   vary widely, from zero to 10(-2), between laboratory
                   lines. This variability in transposition rate is
                   controlled by host genes. It is probable that in nature
                   TE site heterogeneity is caused by frequent
                   transpositions in rare flies with permissive alleles,
                   and no transpositions happen in the rest of flies. The
                   average rate of TE transposition in nature may thus
                   depend on the frequency of permissive alleles, which is
                   a function of the rate of mutation from restrictive to
                   permissive alleles, the mechanism and the strength of
                   selection opposing TE multiplication, and population
                   size. Thus, evolution of the frequency of permissive
                   alleles of genes controlling transposition must be
                   accounted for to understand evolution of TE copy
                   numbers.},

                   subroutines, not as a collection of independent genetic
                   'units'. DNA sequences which do not code for protein
                   structure determine the system architecture of the
                   genome. Repetitive DNA elements serve as tags to mark
                   and integrate different protein coding sequences into
                   coordinately functioning groups, to build up systems
                   for genome replication and distribution to daughter
                   cells, and to organize chromatin. Genomes can be
                   reorganized through the action of cellular systems for
                   cutting, splicing and rearranging DNA molecules.
                   Natural genetic engineering systems (including
                   transposable elements) are capable of acting
                   genome-wide and not just one site at a time.
                   Transposable elements are subject to regulation by
                   cellular signal transduction/computing networks. This
                   regulation acts on both the timing and extent of DNA
                   rearrangements and (in a few documented cases so far)

                   "natural" hierarchical classification of all living
                   things. Although confidence in some of the tree's early
                   branches has recently been shaken, new approaches could
                   still resolve many methodological uncertainties. More
                   challenging is evidence that most archaeal and
                   bacterial genomes (and the inferred ancestral
                   eukaryotic nuclear genome) contain genes from multiple
                   sources. If "chimerism" or "lateral gene transfer"
                   cannot be dismissed as trivial in extent or limited to
                   special categories of genes, then no hierarchical
                   universal classification can be taken as natural.
                   Molecular phylogeneticists will have failed to find the
                   "true tree," not because their methods are inadequate
                   or because they have chosen the wrong genes, but
                   because the history of life cannot properly be
                   represented as a tree. However, taxonomies based on
                   molecular sequences will remain indispensable, and
                   understanding of the evolutionary process will
                   ultimately be enriched, not impoverished.},

                   to separate phylogenetic trees of a non-long terminal
                   repeat retrotransposable element into either internal
                   branches, representing mainly the constrained evolution
                   of active lineages, or into terminal branches,
                   representing mainly nonfunctional "dead-on-arrival"
                   copies that are unconstrained by selection and evolve
                   as pseudogenes. The pattern of nucleotide substitutions
                   in unconstrained sequences is expected to be congruent
                   with the pattern of point mutation. We examined the
                   retrotransposon Helena in the Drosophila virilis
                   species group (subgenus Drosophila) and the Drosophila
                   melanogaster species subgroup (subgenus Sophophora).
                   The patterns of point mutation are indistinguishable,
                   suggesting considerable stability over evolutionary
                   time (40-60 million years). The relative frequencies of
                   different point mutations are unequal, but the
                   "transition bias" results largely from an approximately
                   2-fold excess of G.C to A.T substitutions. Spontaneous
                   mutation is biased toward A.T base pairs, with an
                   expected mutational equilibrium of approximately 65% A
                   + T (quite similar to that of long introns). These data
                   also enable the first detailed comparison of patterns
                   of point mutations in Drosophila and mammals. Although
                   the patterns are different, all of the statistical
                   significance comes from a much greater rate of G.C to
                   A.T substitution in mammals, probably because of
                   methylated cytosine "hotspots." When the G.C to A.T
                   substitutions are discounted, the remaining differences
                   are considerably reduced and not statistically
                   significant.},

                   patterns of DNA evolution in Drosophila takes advantage
                   of the propensity of non-LTR retrotransposable elements
                   to create nonfunctional, transpositionally inactive
                   copies as a product of transposition. For many LINE
                   elements, most copies present in a genome at any one
                   time are nonfunctional "dead-on-arrival" (DOA) copies.
                   Because these are off-shoots of active,
                   transpositionally competent "master" lineages, in a
                   gene tree of a LINE element from multiple samples from
                   related species, the DOA lineages are expected to map
                   to the terminal branches and the active lineages to the
                   internal branches, the primary exceptions being when
                   the sample includes DOA copies that are allelic or
                   orthologous. Analysis of nucleotide substitutions and
                   other changes along the terminal branches therefore
                   allows estimation of the fixation process in the DOA
                   copies, which are unconstrained with respect to protein
                   coding; and under selective neutrality, the fixation
                   process estimates the underlying mutational pattern. We
                   have studied the retroelement Helena in Drosophila. An
                   unexpectedly high rate of DNA loss was observed,
                   yielding a half-life of unconstrained DNA sequences
                   approximately 60-fold faster in Drosophila than in
                   mammals. The high rate of DNA loss suggests a
                   straightforward explanation of the seeming paradox that
                   Drosophila has many fewer pseudogenes than found in
                   mammalian species. Differential rates of deletion in
                   different taxa might also contribute to the celebrated
                   C-value paradox of why some closely related organisms
                   can have very different DNA contents. New data
                   presented here rule out the possibility that the
                   transposition process itself is highly mutagenic, hence
                   the observed linear relation between number of
                   deletions and number of nucleotide substitutions is
                   most easily explained by the hypothesis that both types
                   of changes accumulate in unconstrained sequences over
                   time.},

                   great differences between TE distributions, even among

                   according to the phylogeny of their host species;

                   divergence between populations could result in genomic
                   incompatibilities that would cause an increase in
                   transposition in their hybrids, producing secondary
                   effects such as sterility and therefore starting a
                   speciation process. It has been demonstrated that
                   transposition largely depends on intraspecific
                   hybridization for P, hobo, and I elements in Drosophila
                   melanogaster and for several elements, including long
                   terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, in
                   D. virilis. However, in order to demonstrate the
                   putative effect of transposable elements on speciation,
                   high levels of transposition should also be induced in
                   hybrids between species that could have been originated
                   by this process and that are still able to interbreed.
                   To test this hypothesis, we studied the transposition
                   of the LTR retrotransposon Osvaldo in Drosophila
                   buzzatii-Drosophila koepferae hybrids. We used a simple
                   and robust experimental design, analyzing large samples
                   of single-pair mate offspring, which allowed us to
                   detect new insertions by in situ hybridization to
                   polytene chromosomes. In order to compare transposition
                   rates, we also used a stock recently obtained from the
                   field and a highly inbred D. buzzatii strain. Our
                   results show that the transposition rate of Osvaldo is
                   10(-3) transpositions per element per generation in all
                   nonhybrid samples, very high when compared with those
                   of other transposable elements. In hybrids, the
                   transposition rate was always 10(-2), significantly
                   higher than in nonhybrids. We show that inbreeding has
                   no effect on transposition in the strains used,
                   concluding that hybridization significantly increases
                   the Osvaldo transposition rate.},

                   retrotransposons share a common structural
                   organization. The main difference between these
                   retroelements is the presence of a functional envelope
                   (env) gene in retroviruses, which is absent or
                   nonfunctional in LTR retrotransposons. Several
                   similarities between these two groups of retroelements
                   have been detected for the reverse transcriptase, gag,
                   and integrase domains. Assuming that each of these
                   domains shares a common ancestral sequence, several
                   hypotheses could account for the emergence of
                   retroviruses from LTR retrotransposons. In this
                   context, the positions of elements such as gypsy and
                   the members of the Ty3 subfamily are not clear, since
                   they are classified as retroviruses but
                   phylogenetically they are assigned to the LTR
                   retrotransposon group. We compared the env gene
                   products of these retroelements and identified two
                   similar motifs in retroviruses and LTR
                   retrotransposons. These two regions do not occur in the
                   same order. If we assume that they are derived from the
                   same ancestral sequence, this could result from
                   independent acquisition of the various domains rather
                   than the single acquisition of the whole env gene.
                   However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the env
                   gene was reorganized after being acquired. Trees based
                   on these regions show that these two groups of elements
                   are clearly distinguished. These trees are similar to
                   those obtained from reverse transcriptase or integrase.
                   In trees based on reverse transcriptase, the
                   retroviruses with complete or partial env genes can be
                   distinguished from the other LTR retrotransposons.},

                   We begin with a synthesis of what we know about the
                   evolution of the mariner elements in the Drosophilidae
                   family in terms of populations and species. We suggest
                   that internal deletion does not occur at random, but
                   appears to frequently occur between short internal
                   repeats. We compared the functional domains of the DNA
                   and/or amino acid sequences to detect similarities
                   between the main classes of elements. This included the

                   individual-based model learns of course a great deal,
                   but what has ecology as a whole learned from the
                   individual- based models published during the last
                   decade? Answering this question proves extremely
                   difficult as there is no common motivation behind
                   individual-based models. The distinction is introduced
                   between 'pragmatic' motivation, which uses the
                   individual-based approach as a tool without any
                   reference to the theoretical issues which have emerged
                   from the classical state variable approach and
                   'paradigmatic' motivation, which explicitly refers to
                   theoretical ecology. A mini-review of 50
                   individual-based animal population models shows that
                   the majority are driven by pragmatic motivation. Most
                   models are very complex and special techniques to cope
                   with this complexity during their analysis are only
                   occasionally applied. It is suggested that in order to
                   orient individual-based modelling more towards general
                   theoretical issues, we need increased explicit
                   reference to theoretical ecology and an advanced
                   strategy for building and analysing individual-based
                   models. To this end, a heuristic list of rules is
                   presented which may help us to advance the practice of
                   individual-based modelling and to learn more general
                   lessons from individual-based modelling in the future
                   than we have during the last decade. The main ideas
                   behind these rules are as follows: (1) Individual-based
                   models usually make more realistic assumptions than
                   state variable models, but it should not be forgotten
                   that the aim of individual-based modelling is not
                   'realism' but modelling. (2) The individual-based
                   approach is a bottom-up approach which starts with the
                   'parts' (i.e. individuals) of a system (i.e.
                   population) and then tries to understand how the
                   system's properties emerge from the interaction among
                   these parts. However, bottom-up approaches alone will
                   never lead to theories at the systems level. State
                   variable or top-down approaches are needed to provide
                   an appropriate integrated view, i.e. the relevant
                   questions at the population level.},

                   genetically engineer insect strains carrying a
                   conditional lethal trait on multiple loci. We model the
                   release into a target pest population of insects
                   carrying a dominant and fully penetrant conditional
                   lethal trait on 1-20 loci. Delaying the lethality for
                   several generations after release allows the trait to
                   become widely spread in the target population before
                   being activated. To determine effectiveness and optimal
                   strategies for such releases, we vary release size,
                   number of generations until the conditional lethality,
                   nonconditional fitness cost resulting from gene
                   insertions, and fitness reduction associated with
                   laboratory rearing. We show that conditional lethal
                   releases are potentially orders of magnitude more
                   effective than sterile male releases of equal size, and
                   that far smaller release sizes may be required for this
                   approach than necessary with sterile males. For
                   example, a release of male insects carrying a
                   conditional lethal allele that is activated in the F4
                   generation on 10 loci reduces the target populatioin to
                   10(-4) of no-release size if there are initially two
                   released males for every wild male. We show how the
                   effectiveness of conditional lethal releases decreases
                   as the nonconditional fitness reduction (i.e., fitness
                   reduction before the trait becomes lethal) associated
                   with the conditional lethal genes increases. For
                   example, if there is a 5\% nonconditional fitness cost
                   per conditional lethal allele, then a 2:1 (released
                   male:wild male) release with conditional lethal alleles
                   that are activated in the F4 generation reduces the
                   population to 2-5\% (depending on the degree of density
                   dependence) of the no-release size. If there is a
                   per-allele reduction in fitness, then as the number of
                   loci is increased there is a trade-off between the
                   fraction of offspring carrying at least one conditional
                   lethal allele and the fitness of the released insects.
                   We calculate the optimal number of loci on which to
                   insert the conditional lethal gene given various
                   conditions. In addition, we show how laboratory-rearing

  abstract       = {Pseudogenes are nonfunctional copies of protein-coding
                   genes that are presumed to evolve without selective
                   constraints on their coding function. They are of
                   considerable utility in evolutionary genetics because,
                   in the absence of selection, different types of
                   mutations in pseudogenes should have equal
                   probabilities of fixation. This theoretical inference
                   justifies the estimation of patterns of spontaneous
                   mutation from the analysis of patterns of substitutions
                   in pseudogenes. Although it is possible to test whether
                   pseudogene sequences evolve without constraints for
                   their protein-coding function, it is much more
                   difficult to ascertain whether pseudogenes may affect
                   fitness in ways unrelated to their nucleotide sequence.
                   Consider the possibility that a pseudogene affects
                   fitness merely by increasing genome size. If a larger
                   genome is deleterious--for example, because of
                   increased energetic costs associated with genome
                   replication and maintenance--then deletions, which
                   decrease the length of a pseudogene, should be
                   selectively advantageous relative to insertions or
                   nucleotide substitutions. In this article we examine
                   the implications of selection for genome size relative
                   to small (1-400 bp) deletions, in light of empirical
                   evidence pertaining to the size distribution of
                   deletions observed in Drosophila and mammalian
                   pseudogenes. There is a large difference in the
                   deletion spectra between these organisms. We argue that
                   this difference cannot easily be attributed to
                   selection for overall genome size, since the magnitude
                   of selection is unlikely to be strong enough to
                   significantly affect the probability of fixation of
                   small deletions in Drosophila.},

                   history. We discuss both maximum-likelihood parameter
                   estimation and demographic hypothesis testing.
                   Simulations are carried out to investigate the
                   statistical properties of maximum-likelihood estimates
                   of demographic parameters. The simulations reveal that

                   estimates is determined by a simple function of the
                   true parameter values and (ii) under some conditions,
                   estimates from reconstructed trees perform as well as
                   estimates from perfect trees. We apply our methods to

                   repeats (TIRs) of some miniature inverted-repeat
                   transposable element (MITE) families isolated from a
                   wide range of organisms, including plants, insects, and
                   humans, and TIRs of DNA transposons from the pogo
                   family. We present here evidence that one of these MITE
                   families, previously described for Arabidopsis
                   thaliana, is derived from a larger element encoding a
                   putative transposase. We have named this novel class II
                   transposon Lemi1. We show that its putative product is
                   related to transposases of the Tc1/mariner superfamily,
                   being closer to the pogo family. A similar truncated
                   element was found in a tomato DNA sequence, indicating
                   an ancient origin and/or horizontal transfer for this
                   family of elements. These results are reminiscent of
                   those recently reported for the human genome, where
                   other members of the pogo family, named Tiggers, are
                   believed to be responsible for the generation of
                   abundant MITE-like elements in an early primate
                   ancestor. These results further suggest that some MITE
                   families, which are highly reiterated in plant, insect,
                   and human genomes, could have arisen from a similar
                   mechanism, implicating pogo-like elements.},

                   Mimo, from the mosquito Culex pipiens. Structural
                   characteristics of these elements fit well with those
                   of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements
                   (MITEs), which are ubiquitous and highly abundant in
                   plant genomes. The occurrence of Mimo in C. pipiens
                   provides new evidence that MITEs are not restricted to
                   plant genomes, but may be widespread in arthropods as
                   well. The copy number of Mimo elements in C. pipiens (
                   approximately 1000 copies in a 540Mb genome) supports
                   the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation
                   between genome size and the magnitude of MITE
                   proliferation. In contrast to most MITE families
                   described so far, members of the Mimo family share a
                   high sequence conservation, which may reflect a recent
                   amplification history in this species. In addition, we
                   found that Mimo elements are a frequent nest for other
                   MITE-like elements, suggesting that multiple and
                   successive MITE transposition events have occurred very
                   recently in the C. pipiens genome. Despite evidence for
                   recent mobility of these MITEs, no element has been
                   found to encode a protein; therefore, we do not know
                   how they have transposed and have spread in the genome.
                   However, some sequence similarities in terminal
                   inverted-repeats suggest a possible filiation of some
                   of these mosquito MITEs with pogo-like DNA transposons.},

                   of science, engineering, and policy making. Typically,
                   these are complex models that attempt to capture
                   underlying mechanisms in considerable detail, and they
                   have many user-specified inputs. The inputs are often
                   specified by some form of trial-and-error approach in
                   which plausible values are postulated, the
                   corresponding outputs inspected, and the inputs
                   modified until plausible outputs are obtained. Here we
                   address the issue of more formal inference for such
                   models. A probabilistic approach, called Bayesian
                   synthesis, was shown to suffer from the Borel paradox,
                   according to which the results can depend on the
                   parameterization of the model. We propose a modified
                   approach, called Bayesian melding, which takes into
                   full account information and uncertainty about both
                   inputs and outputs to the model, while avoiding the
                   Borel paradox. This is done by recognizing the
                   existence of two priors, one implicit and one explicit,
                   on each input and output; these are combined via
                   logarithmic pooling. Bayesian melding is then standard
                   Bayesian inference with the pooled prior on inputs, and
                   is implemented here by posterior simulation using the
                   sampling-importance-resampling (SIR) algorithm. We
                   develop this initially for invertible models, and then
                   extend it to the more difficult and more common case of
                   noninvertible models. We illustrate the methodology
                   using a number of examples. Simulation studies show
                   that the method outperforms a simpler Bayesian approach
                   in terms of mean squared error. A number of open
                   research problems are discussed. },

  abstract       = {With recent advances in genetics, many new strategies
                   for pest control have become feasible. This is the
                   second article in which we model new techniques for
                   pest control based on the mass release of genetically
                   modified insects. In this article we model the release
                   of insects carrying a dominant and redundant female
                   killing or sterilizing (FK) allele on multiple genetic
                   loci. If such insects are released into a target
                   population, the FK allele can become widely spread in
                   the population through the males while reducing the
                   population each generation by killing females. We allow
                   the number of loci used to vary from 1 to 20. We also
                   allow the FK allele to carry a fitness cost in males
                   due to the gene insertions. Using a model, we explore
                   the effectiveness and optimal strategies for such
                   releases. In the most ideal circumstances (no
                   density-dependence and released insects equal in
                   fitness to wild ones), FK releases are several orders
                   of magnitude more effective than equal sized sterile
                   male releases. For example, a single release of 19
                   FK-bearing males for every two wild males, with the
                   released males carrying the FK allele on 10 loci,
                   reduces the target population to 0.002\% of no-release
                   size. An equal sized sterile release reduces the target
                   population to 5\% of no-release size. We also show how
                   the effectiveness of the technique decreases as the
                   fitness cost of the FK alleles in males increases. For
                   example, the above mentioned release reduces the target
                   population to 0.7\% of no-release size if each FK
                   allele carries a fitness cost in males of 5\%. Adding a
                   simple model for density-dependence and assuming that
                   each of the released males carries the FK allele on six
                   loci, we show that the release size necessary to reduce
                   the target population to 1/100 of no-release size in 10
                   generations of releases varies from 0.44:1 to 4:1
                   (depending on parameter values). We also calculate the
                   optimal number of loci on which to put the FK allele

  abstract       = {The activity of transposable elements can be induced
                   by environmental and population factors and in
                   particular by stresses in various organisms. A
                   consequence of the increase in transposable element
                   mobility is the creation of new genetic variability
                   that can be useful in the face of stressful conditions.
                   In this review, results supporting this hypothesis are
                   presented and discussed. The main question is how
                   stress induces the activity of transposable elements.
                   We discuss hypotheses based upon the existence of
                   promoters or fixation sites of transcription activators
                   in the untranslated regions of transposable elements,
                   similar to those found in regulatory regions of host
                   defence genes.},

  abstract       = {The fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most
                   intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as
                   a model system for the investigation of many
                   developmental and cellular processes common to higher
                   eukaryotes, including humans. We have determined the
                   nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately
                   120-megabase euchromatic portion of the Drosophila
                   genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy
                   supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a
                   high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical
                   map. Efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps;
                   however, the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and
                   contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to
                   support an initial analysis of genome structure and
                   preliminary gene annotation and interpretation. The
                   genome encodes approximately 13,600 genes, somewhat
                   fewer than the smaller Caenorhabditis elegans genome,
                   but with comparable functional diversity.},

                   of liver disease. Here, we use a new model of HCV
                   spread to investigate the epidemic behavior of the
                   virus and to estimate its basic reproductive number
                   from gene sequence data. We find significant
                   differences in epidemic behavior among HCV subtypes and
                   suggest that these differences are largely the result
                   of subtype-specific transmission patterns. Our model
                   builds a bridge between the disciplines of population
                   genetics and mathematical epidemiology by using
                   pathogen gene sequences to infer the population dynamic

  abstract       = {SINEs are short interspersed repetitive elements found
                   in many eukaryotic genomes and are believed to
                   propagate by retroposition. Almost all SINEs reported
                   to date have a composite structure made of a 5'
                   tRNA-related region followed by a tRNA-unrelated
                   region. Here, we describe a new type of tRNA-derived
                   SINEs from the genome of the mosquito Culex pipiens.
                   These elements, called TWINs, are approximately 220 bp
                   long and reiterated at approximately 500 copies per
                   haploid genome. TWINs have a unique structure compared
                   with other tRNA-SINEs described so far. They consist of
                   two tRNA(Arg)-related regions separated by a 39-bp
                   spacer. Other tRNA-unrelated sequences include a 5-bp
                   leader preceding the left tRNA-like unit and a short
                   trailer located downstream of the right tRNA-like
                   region. This 3' trailer is a 10-bp sequence that is
                   ended by a TTTT motif and followed by a polyA tract of
                   variable length. The right tRNA-like unit also contains
                   a 16-bp sequence which is absent in the left one and
                   appears to be located in the ancestral anticodon stem
                   precisely at a position expected for a nuclear tRNA
                   intron. According to this singular structure, we
                   hypothesize that the TWIN: SINE family originated from
                   an unprocessed polymerase III transcript containing two
                   tRNA sequences. We suggest that some peculiar
                   properties acquired by this dicistronic transcript,
                   such as a polyA tail and a 3' stem-loop secondary
                   structure, promote its retroposition by increasing its
                   chances of being recognized by a reverse transcriptase
                   encoded elsewhere in the C. pipiens genome.},

  abstract       = {Impala is an active DNA transposon family that was
                   first identified in a strain of Fusarium oxysporum
                   pathogenic to melon. The 10 copies present in this
                   strain define three subfamilies that differ by about
                   20\% at the nucleotide level. This high level of
                   polymorphism suggests the existence of an ancestral
                   polymorphism associated with vertical transmission
                   and/or the introduction of some subfamilies by
                   horizontal transfer from another species. To gain
                   insights into the molecular evolution of this family,
                   impala distribution was investigated in strains with
                   various host specificities by Southern blot, PCR, and
                   sequencing. Detection of impala elements in most of the
                   F. oxysporum strains tested indicates that impala is an
                   ancient component of the F. oxysporum genome.
                   Subfamily-specific amplifications and sequence and
                   phylogenetic analyses revealed five subfamilies,
                   several of which can be found within the same genome.
                   This supports the hypothesis of an ancestral
                   polymorphism followed by vertical transmission and
                   independent evolution in the host-specific forms.
                   Highly similar elements showing unique features
                   (internal deletions, high rates of CG-to-TA
                   transitions) or being present at the same genomic
                   location were identified in several strains with
                   different host specificities, raising questions about
                   the phylogenetic relationships of these strains. A
                   phylogenetic analysis performed by sequencing a portion
                   of the EF1alpha gene showed in most cases a correlation
                   between the presence of a particular element and a
                   close genetic relationship. All of these data provide
                   important information on the evolutionary origin of
                   this element and reveal its potential as a valuable
                   tool for tracing populations.},

                   It is argued that easy popular appellations such as
                   "selfish DNA" and "junk DNA" may be either inaccurate
                   or misleading and that a more enlightened view of the
                   transposable element-host relationship encompasses a
                   continuum from extreme parasitism to mutualism.
                   Transposable elements are potent, broad spectrum,
                   endogenous mutators that are subject to the influence
                   of chance as well as selection at several levels of

                   transposable element traits that early evolve neutrally

                   several other transposons in dysgenic crosses in
                   Drosophila virilis. Its structure proved to be complex
                   and to vary greatly in all examined species of the
                   virilis group. Phylogenetic analysis of the reverse
                   transcriptase (RT) domain assigned Penelope to a new
                   branch, rather than to any known family, of LTR-lacking
                   retroelements. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that
                   the C-terminal domain of the Penelope polyprotein is an
                   active endonuclease, which is related to intron-encoded
                   endonucleases and to bacterial repair endonuclease
                   UrvC, and may act as an integras. Retroelements coding
                   for a putative endonuclease that differs from typical
                   integrase have thus far not been known. The N-terminal
                   domain of the Penelope polyprotein was shown to contain
                   a protease with significant homology to HIV-1 protease.
                   Phylogenetic analysis divided the Penelope copies from
                   several virilis species into two subfamilies, one
                   including virtually identical full-length copies, and
                   the other comprising highly divergent defective copies.
                   The results suggest both vertical and horizontal
                   transfer of the element. Possibly, Penelope invasion
                   recurred during evolution and contributed to genome
                   rearrangement in the virilis species. Chromosome
                   aberrations detected in D. virilis, which is now being
                   invaded by Penelope, is direct evidence for this

                   correlated with genome size in animals. These studies
                   include a comparison between Drosophila and the
                   cricket, Laupala, but there has been no assessment of
                   DNA loss in insects with very large genomes. Podisma
                   pedestris, the brown mountain grasshopper, has a genome
                   over 100 times as large as that of Drosophila and 10
                   times as large as that of Laupala. We used 58
                   paralogous nuclear pseudogenes of mitochondrial origin
                   to study the characteristics of insertion, deletion,
                   and point substitution in P. pedestris and
                   Italopodisma. In animals, these pseudogenes are "dead
                   on arrival"; they are abundant in many different
                   eukaryotes, and their mitochondrial origin simplifies
                   the identification of point substitutions accumulated
                   in nuclear pseudogene lineages. There appears to be a
                   mononucleotide repeat within the 643-bp pseudogene
                   sequence studied that acts as a strong hot spot for
                   insertions or deletions (indels). Because the data for
                   other insect species did not contain such an unusual
                   region, hot spots were excluded from species
                   comparisons. The rate of DNA loss relative to point
                   substitution appears to be considerably and
                   significantly lower in the grasshoppers studied than in
                   Drosophila or Laupala. This suggests that the inverse
                   correlation between genome size and the rate of DNA
                   loss can be extended to comparisons between insects
                   with large or gigantic genomes (i.e., Laupala and
                   Podisma). The low rate of DNA loss implies that in
                   grasshoppers, the accumulation of point mutations is a
                   more potent force for obscuring ancient pseudogenes
                   than their loss through indel accumulation, whereas the
                   reverse is true for Drosophila. The main factor
                   contributing to the difference in the rates of DNA loss
                   estimated for grasshoppers, crickets, and Drosophila
                   appears to be deletion size. Large deletions are
                   relatively rare in Podisma and Italopodisma.},

                   previously unknown category of eukaryotic DNA
                   transposons, Helitron, which transpose by
                   rolling-circle replication. Autonomous Helitrons encode
                   a 5'-to-3' DNA helicase and nuclease/ligase similar to
                   those encoded by known rolling-circle replicons.
                   Helitron-like transposons have conservative 5'-TC and
                   CTRR-3' termini and do not have terminal inverted
                   repeats. They contain 16- to 20-bp hairpins separated
                   by 10--12 nucleotides from the 3'-end and transpose
                   precisely between the 5'-A and T-3', with no
                   modifications of the AT target sites. Together with
                   their multiple diverged nonautonomous descendants,
                   Helitrons constitute approximately 2\% of both the
                   Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes
                   and also colonize the Oriza sativa genome. Sequence

                   (MITEs) are widespread and abundant in both plant and
                   animal genomes. Despite the discovery and
                   characterization of many MITE families, their origin
                   and transposition mechanism are still poorly
                   understood, largely because MITEs are nonautonomous
                   elements with no coding capacity. The starting point
                   for this study was P instability factor (PIF), an
                   active DNA transposable element family from maize that
                   was first identified following multiple mutagenic
                   insertions into exactly the same site in intron 2 of
                   the maize anthocyanin regulatory gene R. In this study
                   we report the isolation of a maize Tourist-like MITE
                   family called miniature PIF (mPIF) that shares several
                   features with PIF elements, including identical
                   terminal inverted repeats, similar subterminal
                   sequences, and an unusual but striking preference for
                   an extended 9-bp target site. These shared features
                   indicate that mPIF and PIF elements were amplified by
                   the same or a closely related transposase. This
                   transposase was identified through the isolation of
                   several PIF elements and the identification of one
                   element (called PIFa) that cosegregated with PIF
                   activity. PIFa encodes a putative protein with homologs
                   in Arabidopsis, rice, sorghum, nematodes, and a fungus.
                   Our data suggest that PIFa and these PIF-like elements
                   belong to a new eukaryotic DNA transposon superfamily
                   that is distantly related to the bacterial IS5 group
                   and are responsible for the origin and spread of
                   Tourist-like MITEs.},

                   host genome evolution is reassessed considering
                   numerous recent developments in many areas of biology.
                   It is argued that easy popular appellations such as
                   "selfish DNA" and "junk DNA" may be either inaccurate
                   or misleading and that a more enlightened view of the
                   transposable element-host relationship encompasses a
                   continuum from extreme parasitism to mutualism.
                   Transposable elements are potent, broad spectrum,
                   endogenous mutators that are subject to the influence
                   of chance as well as selection at several levels of
                   biological organization. Of particular interest are
                   transposable element traits that early evolve neutrally
                   at the host level but at a later stage of evolution are
                   co-opted for new host functions.},

                   information. Bioperl provides an easy-to-use, stable,
                   and consistent programming interface for bioinformatics
                   application programmers. The Bioperl modules have been
                   successfully and repeatedly used to reduce otherwise
                   complex tasks to only a few lines of code. The Bioperl
                   object model has been proven to be flexible enough to
                   support enterprise-level applications such as EnsEMBL,
                   while maintaining an easy learning curve for novice
                   Perl programmers. Bioperl is capable of executing
                   analyses and processing results from programs such as
                   BLAST, ClustalW, or the EMBOSS suite. Interoperation
                   with modules written in Python and Java is supported
                   through the evolving BioCORBA bridge. Bioperl provides
                   access to data stores such as GenBank and SwissProt via
                   a flexible series of sequence input/output modules, and
                   to the emerging common sequence data storage format of
                   the Open Bioinformatics Database Access project. This
                   study describes the overall architecture of the
                   toolkit, the problem domains that it addresses, and
                   gives specific examples of how the toolkit can be used
                   to solve common life-sciences problems. We conclude
                   with a discussion of how the open-source nature of the
                   project has contributed to the development effort.},

                   in plants. On the basis of these two plant MLEs and
                   several related sequences identified by database
                   searches, plant-specific degenerate primers were
                   derived and used to amplify a conserved region of MLE
                   transposase genes from a variety of plant genomes.
                   Positive products were obtained for 6 dicots and 31
                   monocots of 54 plant species tested. Phylogenetic
                   analysis of 68 distinct MLE transposase sequences from
                   25 grass species is consistent with vertical
                   transmission and rapid diversification of multiple
                   lineages of transposases. Surprisingly, the evolution
                   of MLEs in grasses was accompanied by repeated and

                   deaths per year, but the actual figures could be
                   substantially higher owing to under-reporting and
                   difficulties in diagnosis. If no new control measures
                   are developed, the malaria death toll is projected to
                   double in the next 20 years. Efforts to control the
                   disease are hampered by drug resistance in the
                   Plasmodium parasites, insecticide resistance in
                   mosquitoes, and the lack of an effective vaccine.
                   Because mosquitoes are obligatory vectors for malaria
                   transmission, the spread of malaria could be curtailed
                   by rendering them incapable of transmitting parasites.
                   Many of the tools required for the genetic manipulation
                   of mosquito competence for malaria transmission have
                   been developed. Foreign genes can now be introduced
                   into the germ line of both culicine and anopheline
                   mosquitoes, and these transgenes can be expressed in a
                   tissue-specific manner. Here we report on the use of
                   such tools to generate transgenic mosquitoes that
                   express antiparasitic genes in their midgut epithelium,
                   thus rendering them inefficient vectors for the
                   disease. These findings have significant implications
                   for the development of new strategies for malaria
                   control.},

  Title          = {A theoretical approach to predicting the success of
                   genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes in malaria
                   control.},
  Journal        = {Malar J},
  Volume         = {1},
  Pages          = {3},
  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes that have been genetically
                   modified to better encapsulate the malaria parasite
                   Plasmodium falciparum are being considered as a
                   possible tool in the control of malaria. Hopes for this
                   have been raised with the identification of genes
                   involved in the encapsulation response and with
                   advances in the tools required to transform mosquitoes.
                   However, we have only very little understanding of the
                   conditions that would allow such genes to spread in
                   natural populations. METHODS: We present here a
                   theoretical model that combines population genetical
                   and epidemiological processes, thereby allowing one to
                   predict not only these conditions (intensity of
                   transmission, evolutionary cost of resistance, tools
                   used to drive the genes) but also the impact of the
                   spread of refractoriness on the prevalence of the
                   disease. RESULTS: The main conclusions are 1) that
                   efficient transposons will generally be able to drive
                   genes that confer refractoriness through populations
                   even if there is a substantial (evolutionary) cost of
                   refractoriness, but 2) that this will decrease malaria
                   prevalence in the human population substantially only
                   if refractoriness is close to 100\% effective.
                   CONCLUSIONS: If refractoriness is less than 100\%
                   effective (because of, for example, environmentally
                   induced variation in the effectiveness of the
                   mosquito's immune response), control programmes based
                   on genetic manipulation of mosquitoes will have very
                   little impact on the epidemiology of malaria, at least
                   in areas with intense transmission.},

                   triple-infected with distinct lineages of Wolbachia
                   endosymbiont, wBruCon, wBruOri, and wBruAus, which were
                   identified by their wsp (Wolbachia surface protein)
                   gene sequences. Whereas wBruCon and wBruOri caused
                   cytoplasmic incompatibility of the host insect, wBruAus
                   did not. Although wBruCon and wBruOri were easily
                   eliminated by antibiotic treatments, wBruAus persisted
                   over five treated generations and could not be
                   eliminated. The inheritance pattern of wBruAus was,
                   surprisingly, explained by sex-linked inheritance in
                   male-heterozygotic organisms, which agreed with the
                   karyotype of C. chinensis (2n = 20, XY). Quantitative
                   PCR analysis demonstrated that females contain around
                   twice as much wsp titer as males, which is concordant
                   with an X chromosome linkage. Specific PCR and Southern
                   blot analyses indicated that the wBruAus-bearing strain
                   of C. chinensis contains only a fraction of the
                   Wolbachia gene repertoire. Several genome fragments of
                   wBruAus were isolated using an inverse PCR technique.
                   The fragments exhibited a bacterial genome structure
                   containing a number of ORFs typical of the
                   alpha-proteobacteria, although some of the ORFs
                   contained disruptive mutations. In the flanking region
                   of ftsZ gene, a non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR)
                   retrotransposon sequence, which is typical of insects
                   but not found from bacteria, was present. These results
                   strongly suggest that wBruAus has no microbial entity
                   but is a genome fragment of Wolbachia endosymbiont
                   transferred to the X chromosome of the host insect.},

                   closely correlated with the amount of repetitive DNA
                   than with the number of coding genes. Major types of
                   repetitive DNA include transposable elements, satellite
                   DNAs, simple sequences and tandem repeats, but reliable
                   estimates of the relative contributions of these
                   various types to total genome size have been hard to
                   obtain. With the advent of genome sequencing, such
                   information is starting to become available, but no
                   firm conclusions can yet be made from the limited data
                   currently available. Here, the ways in which
                   transposable elements contribute both directly and
                   indirectly to genome size variation are explored.
                   Limited evidence is provided to support the existence
                   of an approximately linear relationship between total
                   transposable element DNA and genome size. Copy numbers
                   per family are low and globally constrained in small
                   genomes, but vary widely in large genomes. Thus, the
                   partial release of transposable element copy number
                   constraints appears to be a major characteristic of

  abstract       = {Transposable elements (TEs) play a fundamental role in
                   the evolution of genomes. In Drosophila they are
                   disproportionately represented in regions of low
                   recombination, such as in heterochromatin. This pattern
                   has been attributed to selection against repeated
                   elements in regions of normal recombination, owing to
                   either (1) the slightly deleterious position effects of
                   TE insertions near or into genes, or (2) strong
                   selection against chromosomal abnormalities arising
                   from ectopic exchange between TE repeats. We have used
                   defective non-long-terminal repeat (LTR) TEs that are
                   "dead-on-arrival" (DOA) and unable to transpose in
                   order to estimate spontaneous deletion rates in
                   different constituents of chromatin. These elements
                   have previously provided evidence for an extremely high
                   rate of spontaneous deletion in Drosophila as compared
                   with mammals, potentially explaining at least part of
                   the differences in the genome sizes in these organisms.
                   However, rates of deletion could be overestimated due
                   to positive selection for a smaller likelihood of
                   ectopic exchange. In this article, we show that rates
                   of spontaneous deletion in DOA repeats are as high in
                   heterochromatin and regions of euchromatin with low
                   recombination as they are in regions of euchromatin
                   with normal recombination. We have also examined the
                   age distribution of five non-LTR families throughout
                   the genome. We show that there is substantial variation
                   in the historical pattern of transposition of these
                   TEs. The overrepresentation of TEs in the
                   heterochromatin is primarily due to their longer
                   retention time in heterochromatin, as evidenced by the
                   average time since insertion. Fragments inserted
                   recently are much more evenly distributed in the
                   genome. This contrast demonstrates that the
                   accumulation of TEs in heterochromatin and in
                   euchromatic regions of low recombination is not due to
                   biased transposition but by greater probabilities of
                   fixation in these regions relative to regions of normal
                   recombination.},

                   were at least 100-fold lower than the baseline level of
                   uninterrupted mariner elements. Although composite
                   vectors with inverted duplications were unable to be
                   mobilized at detectable frequencies, vectors with large
                   direct duplications of mariner could be mobilized. A
                   vector consisting of two virtually complete elements
                   flanking exogenous DNA yielded a frequency of somatic
                   eye-color mosaicism of approximately 10\% and a
                   frequency of germline excision of 0.04\%. These values
                   are far smaller than those observed for uninterrupted
                   elements. The results imply that efficient mobilization
                   of mariner in vivo requires the presence and proper
                   spacing of sequences internal to the element as well as
                   the inverted repeats.},

                   has been little progress in controlling this disease.
                   For transmission to occur, the malaria parasite has to
                   complete a complex developmental cycle in the mosquito.
                   The mosquito is therefore a potential weak link in
                   malaria transmission, and generating mosquito
                   populations that are refractory to the parasite is a
                   potential means of controlling the disease. There has
                   been considerable progress over the last decade towards
                   developing the tools for creating a refractory
                   mosquito. Accomplishments include germline
                   transformation of several important mosquito vectors,
                   the completed genomes of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae
                   and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and the
                   identification of promoters and effector genes that
                   confer resistance in the mosquito. These tools have
                   provided researchers with the ability to engineer a
                   refractory mosquito vector, but there are fundamental
                   gaps in our knowledge of how to transfer this
                   technology safely and effectively into field
                   populations. This review considers strategies for
                   interfering with Plasmodium development in the
                   mosquito, together with issues related to the transfer
                   of laboratory-acquired knowledge to the field, such as
                   minimization of transgene fitness load to the mosquito,
                   driving genes through populations, avoiding the
                   selection of resistant strains, and how to produce and

  abstract       = {Stowaway is a superfamily of miniature inverted repeat
                   transposable elements (MITEs) that is widespread and
                   abundant in plant genomes. Like other MITEs, however,
                   its origin and mode of amplification are poorly
                   understood. Several lines of evidence point to plant
                   mariner-like elements (MLEs) as the autonomous partners
                   of the nonautonomous Stowaway MITEs. To better
                   understand this relationship, we have taken advantage
                   of the nearly complete genome sequences of two rice
                   subspecies to generate the first inventory of virtually
                   all MLEs and Stowaway families coexisting in a single
                   plant species. Thirty-four different MLEs were found to
                   group into three major clades and 25 families. More
                   than 22,000 Stowaway MITEs were identified and
                   classified into 36 families. On the basis of detailed
                   sequence comparisons, MLEs were confirmed to be the
                   best candidate autonomous elements for Stowaway MITEs.
                   Surprisingly, however, sequence similarity between MLE
                   and Stowaway families was restricted to the terminal
                   inverted repeats (TIRs) and, in a few cases, to
                   adjacent subterminal sequences. These data suggest a
                   model whereby most of the Stowaway MITEs in rice were
                   cross-mobilized by MLE transposases encoded by
                   distantly related elements.},

                   contribute to the observed variability in virulence,
                   transmission and persistence of viral pathogens. Since
                   most viruses evolve many times faster than their human
                   hosts, we are in the unusual position of being able to
                   measure these processes directly by comparing viral
                   genes that have been isolated and sequenced at
                   different points in time. The analysis of such data
                   requires the use of specific statistical methods that
                   take into account the shared ancestry of the sequences
                   and the randomness inherent in the process of
                   nucleotide substitution. In this paper we describe the
                   various statistical methods for estimating evolutionary
                   rates, which can be classified into three general
                   approaches: linear regression, maximum likelihood, and
                   Bayesian inference. We discuss the advantages and
                   shortcomings of each approach and illustrate their use
                   through the analysis of two example viruses; human
                   immunodeficiency virus type 1 and dengue virus serotype
                   4. Reliable estimates of viral substitution rates have
                   many important applications in population genetics and
                   phylogenetics, including dating evolutionary events and
                   divergence times, estimating demographic parameters
                   such as population size and generation time, and

                   Plasmodium spp., Toxoplasma, and Eimeria,
                   respectively). These parasites contain a relict
                   plastid-termed "apicoplast"--that originated from the
                   engulfment of an organism of the red algal lineage. The
                   apicoplast is indispensable but its exact role in
                   parasites is unknown. The apicoplast has its own genome
                   and expresses a small number of genes, but the vast
                   majority of the apicoplast proteome is encoded in the
                   nuclear genome. The products of these nuclear genes are
                   posttranslationally targeted to the organelle via the
                   secretory pathway courtesy of a bipartite N-terminal
                   leader sequence. Apicoplasts are nonphotosynthetic but
                   retain other typical plastid functions such as fatty
                   acid, isoprenoid and heme synthesis, and products of
                   these pathways might be exported from the apicoplast
                   for use by the parasite. Apicoplast pathways are
                   essentially prokaryotic and therefore excellent drug
                   targets. Some antibiotics inhibiting these molecular
                   processes are already in chemotherapeutic use, whereas
                   many new drugs will hopefully spring from our growing
                   understanding of this intriguing organelle.},

                   parasite virulence a public health priority. The
                   potential for the swift evolution of virulence in
                   response to changes in host ecology has motivated the
                   integration of evolutionary ecology with
                   epidemiological theory, as part of the emerging field
                   of evolutionary epidemiology. Virulence is the product
                   of complex interactions among evolutionary, ecological
                   and epidemiological processes. Recent models that
                   incorporate ideas from both evolutionary ecology and
                   epidemiology generate predictions that could not be
                   made by either discipline alone. These models predict
                   that the ecological or evolutionary changes affecting
                   population dynamics of disease, such as spatial
                   structuring, within-host dynamics, polymorphism in host
                   resistance, host longevity and population size, impose
                   selection on virulence. As disease incidence increases,
                   it becomes particularly important to take into account
                   the implications of infection by multiple parasite
                   strains. Evolutionary epidemic models also identify the
                   potential importance of immune evasion and optimal
                   virulence for the selection of sex in parasites. Thus,
                   merging epidemiology with evolutionary ecology has
                   widespread potential to help us answer evolutionary
                   questions and to guide public health policy.},

                   Bayesian inference has become increasingly popular due
                   to the ability of Bayesian inference to handle complex
                   models of evolution. In this review we concentrate on
                   inference of recombination events between strains of
                   viruses when these events are sporadic, ie rare
                   relative to point mutations. Bayesian inference is
                   especially attractive in the detection of recombination
                   events because it allows for simultaneous inferences
                   about the presence, number and location of crossover
                   points and the identification of parental sequences.
                   Current frequentist recombination identification falls
                   into a sequential testing trap. The most likely
                   parental sequences and crossover points are identified
                   using the data and then the certainty of recombination
                   is assessed conditional on this identification. After
                   briefly outlining basic phylogenetic models, Bayesian
                   inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
                   computation, we summarise three different approaches to
                   recombination detection and discuss current challenges
                   in applying Bayesian phylogenetic inference of

                   diseases has inspired proposals to manage the evolution

                   view is that social interventions that lower pathogen
                   transmission will indirectly select lower virulence
                   because of a trade-off between transmission and
                   virulence. Here, we argue that there is little
                   theoretical justification and no empirical evidence for
                   this plan. Although a trade-off model might apply to
                   some pathogens, the mechanism appears too weak for
                   rapid selection of substantial changes in virulence.
                   Direct selection against virulence itself might be a

                   model complex interactions characterized by individual
                   variability. This paper presents an object-oriented
                   design for individual-based modelling of Plasmodium
                   falciparum malaria transmission. Two kinds of objects,
                   human and mosquito, that exhibit variability among
                   individuals for parameters such as recovery and
                   survival rates are defined. The model tracks the
                   dynamics of human hosts and adult female mosquitoes
                   individually. Immunity, modelled as a function of
                   exposure history, is represented by reduced
                   susceptibility and increased recovery rate. The model
                   was calibrated using epidemiological data collected at
                   30 sites along the coast of Kenya. The sites were
                   grouped into low, intermediate and high transmission
                   based on mean daily human-biting rates. Simulation
                   results show that malaria transmission was stable even
                   in low transmission areas where the human-biting rate
                   is approximately 0.5 bite per day. The model was used
                   to examine the effect of infection control programmes
                   that aim at interrupting transmission by reducing
                   human-vector contact rates and implementing active case
                   detection and drug treatment of infections. With this
                   intervention, local elimination of malaria is likely
                   with a probability of extinction of approximately 0.8
                   in low transmission areas. However, a small amount of
                   immigration (> 0.3\%) by infected people into the
                   community could prevent local extinction of the
                   parasite. In intermediate and high transmission areas,
                   reduction in prevalence is short-lived and the
                   probability of local elimination is low, even at high
                   coverage levels of the intervention.},

                   substantial, sometimes catastrophic, morbidity and
                   mortality. Intense selection from the host immune
                   system drives antigenic change in influenza A and B,
                   resulting in continuous replacement of circulating
                   strains with new variants able to re-infect hosts
                   immune to earlier types. This 'antigenic drift' often
                   requires a new vaccine to be formulated before each
                   annual epidemic. However, given the high
                   transmissibility and mutation rate of influenza, the
                   constancy of genetic diversity within lineages over
                   time is paradoxical. Another enigma is the replacement
                   of existing strains during a global pandemic caused by
                   'antigenic shift'--the introduction of a new avian
                   influenza A subtype into the human population. Here we
                   explore ecological and immunological factors underlying
                   these patterns using a mathematical model capturing
                   both realistic epidemiological dynamics and viral
                   evolution at the sequence level. By matching model
                   output to phylogenetic patterns seen in sequence data
                   collected through global surveillance, we find that
                   short-lived strain-transcending immunity is essential
                   to restrict viral diversity in the host population and
                   thus to explain key aspects of drift and shift
                   dynamics.},

                   male-specific sequences in the species Silene
                   latifolia. One isolated fragment, SLP2, shares
                   similarity to a portion of the Activator (Ac)
                   transposase from Zea mays and to related proteins from
                   other plant species. Southern blot analysis of male and
                   female S. latifolia genomic DNA shows that SLP2 belongs
                   to a low-copy-number repeat family with two Y-linked
                   copies. Screening of a S. latifolia male genomic
                   library using SLP2 as a probe led to the isolation of
                   five clones, which were partially sequenced. One clone
                   contains two large open reading frames that can be
                   joined into a sequence encoding a putative protein of
                   682 amino acids by removing a short intron. Database
                   searches and phylogenetic analysis show that this
                   protein belongs to the hAT superfamily of transposases,
                   closest to Tag2 (Arabidopsis thaliana), and contains
                   all of the defined domains critical for the activity of
                   these transposases. PCR with genomic and cDNA templates
                   from S. latifolia male, female, and hermaphrodite
                   individuals revealed that one of the Y-linked copies is
                   transcriptionally active and alternatively spliced.
                   This is the first report of a transcriptionally active
                   transposable element (TE) family in S. latifolia and
                   the first DNA transposon residing on a plant Y
                   chromosome. The potential activity and regulation of
                   this TE family and its use for Y chromosome gene

                   transposons called Transib. These transposons populate
                   the Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae
                   genomes, use a transposase that is not similar to any
                   known proteins, and are characterized by 5-bp target
                   site duplications. We found that the fly genome, which
                   was thought to be colonized by the P element <100 years
                   ago, harbors approximately 5 million year (Myr)-old
                   fossils of ProtoP, an ancient ancestor of the P
                   element. We also show that Hoppel, a previously
                   reported transposable element (TE), is a nonautonomous
                   derivate of ProtoP. We found that the "rolling-circle"
                   Helitron transposons identified previously in plants
                   and worms populate also insect genomes. Our results
                   indicate that Helitrons were horizontally transferred
                   into the fly or/and mosquito genomes. We have also
                   identified a most abundant TE in the fly genome,
                   DNAREP1\_DM, which is an approximately 10-Myr-old
                   footprint of a Penelope-like retrotransposon. We
                   estimated that TEs are three times more abundant than
                   reported previously, making up approximately 22\% of
                   the whole genome. The chromosomal and age distributions
                   of TEs in D. melanogaster are very similar to those in
                   Arabidopsis thaliana. Both genomes contain only
                   relatively young TEs (<20 Myr old), constituting a main
                   component of paracentromeric regions.},

                   kinds of mutations, constitute a large fraction of the
                   genome. How they invade natural populations and species
                   is therefore of fundamental importance for
                   understanding the dynamics of genetic diversity and
                   genome composition. On the basis of 85 samples of
                   natural populations of Drosophila simulans, we report
                   the distributions of the genome insertion site numbers
                   of nine TEs that were chosen because they have a low
                   average number of sites. Most populations were found to
                   have 0-3 insertion sites, but some of them had a
                   significantly higher number of sites for a given TE.
                   The populations located in regions outside Africa had
                   the highest number of sites for all elements except HMS
                   Beagle and Coral, suggesting a recent increase in the
                   activity of some TEs associated with the colonization
                   patterns of Drosophila simulans. The element Tirant had
                   a very distinctive pattern of distribution: it was
                   identified mainly in populations from East Africa and
                   some islands in the Indian Ocean, and its insertion
                   site number was low in all these populations. The data
                   suggest that the genome of the entire species of
                   Drosophila simulans may be being invaded by TEs from
                   populations in which they are present in high copy

  abstract       = {One of the principal goals of population genetics is
                   to understand the processes by which genetic variation
                   within species (polymorphism) becomes converted into
                   genetic differences between species (divergence). In
                   this transformation, selective neutrality, near
                   neutrality, and positive selection may each play a
                   role, differing from one gene to the next. Synonymous
                   nucleotide sites are often used as a uniform standard
                   of comparison across genes on the grounds that
                   synonymous sites are subject to relatively weak
                   selective constraints and so may, to a first
                   approximation, be regarded as neutral. Synonymous sites
                   are also interdigitated with nonsynonymous sites and so
                   are affected equally by genomic context and demographic
                   factors. Hence a comparison of levels of polymorphism
                   and divergence between synonymous sites and amino acid
                   replacement sites in a gene is potentially informative
                   about the magnitude of selective forces associated with
                   amino acid replacements. We have analyzed 56 genes in
                   which polymorphism data from D. simulans are compared
                   with divergence from a reference strain of D.
                   melanogaster. The framework of the analysis is Bayesian
                   and assumes that the distribution of selective effects
                   (Malthusian fitnesses) is Gaussian with a mean that
                   differs for each gene. In such a model, the average
                   scaled selection intensity (gamma = N(e)s) of amino
                   acid replacements eligible to become polymorphic or
                   fixed is -7.31, and the standard deviation of selective
                   effects within each locus is 6.79 (assuming
                   homoscedasticity across loci). For newly arising
                   mutations of this type that occur in autosomal or
                   X-linked genes, the average proportion of beneficial
                   mutations is 19.7\%. Among the amino acid polymorphisms
                   in the sample, the expected average proportion of
                   beneficial mutations is 47.7\%, and among amino acid
                   replacements that become fixed the average proportion
                   of beneficial mutations is 94.3\%. The average scaled
                   selection intensity of fixed mutations is +5.1. The
                   presence of positive selection is pervasive with the
                   single exception of kl-5, a Y-linked fertility gene. We
                   find no evidence that a significant fraction of fixed
                   amino acid replacements is neutral or nearly neutral or
                   that positive selection drives amino acid replacements
                   at only a subset of the loci. These results are model
                   dependent and we discuss possible modifications of the
                   model that might allow more neutral and nearly neutral
                   amino acid replacements to be fixed.},

  abstract       = {Transposable elements are characterized by their
                   ability to spread within a host genome. Many are also
                   capable of crossing species boundaries to enter new
                   genomes, a process known as horizontal transfer.
                   Focusing mostly on animal transposable elements, we
                   review the occurrence of horizontal transfer and
                   examine the methods used to detect such transfers. We
                   then discuss factors that affect the frequency of
                   horizontal transfer, with emphasis on the mechanism and
                   regulation of transposition. An intriguing feature of
                   horizontal transfer is that its frequency differs among
                   transposable element families. Evidence summarized in
                   this review indicates that this pattern is due to
                   fundamental differences between Class I and Class II
                   elements. There appears to be a gradient in the
                   incidence of horizontal transfer that reflects the
                   presence of DNA intermediates during transposition.
                   Furthermore, horizontal transfer seems to predominate
                   among families for which copy number is controlled
                   predominantly by self-regulatory mechanisms that limit
                   transposition. We contend that these differences play a
                   major role in the observed predominance of horizontal
                   transfer among Class II transposable elements.},

                   that all these element families are primarily composed
                   of fragmentary copies (mostly solos) or full-length
                   copies with inactivating mutations indicates that their
                   turnover rate has been probably very low. Finally,
                   incongruent phylogenies obtained from different regions
                   of the elements strongly suggest that recombination has
                   played a significant role in their evolutionary
                   history.},

  Pages          = {94},
  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Transposable elements (TE) are mobile
                   genetic entities present in nearly all genomes.
                   Previous work has shown that TEs tend to have a
                   different nucleotide composition than the host genes,
                   either considering codon usage bias or dinucleotide
                   frequencies. We show here how these compositional
                   differences can be used as a tool for detection and
                   analysis of TE sequences. RESULTS: We compared the
                   composition of TE sequences and host gene sequences
                   using probabilistic models of nucleotide sequences. We
                   used hidden Markov models (HMM), which take into
                   account the base composition of the sequences
                   (occurrences of words n nucleotides long, with n
                   ranging here from 1 to 4) and the heterogeneity between
                   coding and non-coding parts of sequences. We analyzed
                   three sets of sequences containing class I TEs, class
                   II TEs and genes respectively in three species:
                   Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and
                   Arabidopsis thaliana. Each of these sets had a
                   distinct, homogeneous composition, enabling us to
                   distinguish between the two classes of TE and the
                   genes. However the particular base composition of the
                   TEs differed in the three species studied. CONCLUSIONS:
                   This approach can be used to detect and annotate TEs in
                   genomic sequences and complements the current
                   homology-based TE detection methods. Furthermore, the
                   HMM method is able to identify the parts of a sequence
                   in which the nucleotide composition resembles that of a
                   coding region of a TE. This is useful for the detailed
                   annotation of TE sequences, which may contain an
                   ancient, highly diverged coding region that is no
                   longer fully functional.},

                   structural regions, we sequenced P elements from
                   strains of Drosophila willistoni and Drosophila
                   sturtevanti sampled from across the distributions of
                   these species. Elements from D. sturtevanti exhibited
                   considerable sequence variation, and similarity among
                   them was correlated to geographic distance between
                   collection sites. By contrast, all D. willistoni
                   elements sampled were essentially identical (pi < 0.2%)
                   and exhibited patterns typical of a recent population
                   expansion. While the canonical P elements sampled from
                   D. sturtevanti appear to be long-time residents in that
                   species, a rapid expansion of a very young canonical
                   P-element lineage is suggested in D. willistoni,
                   overcoming barriers such as large geographical
                   distances and moderate levels of population
                   subdivision. Between-species comparisons reveal
                   selective constraints on P-element evolution, as
                   indicated by significantly different substitution rates
                   in noncoding, silent, and replacement sites. Most
                   remarkably, in addition to replacement sites, selection
                   pressure appears to be strong in the first and third
                   introns and in the 3' and 5' flanking regions.},

  abstract       = {Endogenous retrovirus (ERV) families are derived from
                   their exogenous counterparts by means of a process of
                   germ-line infection and proliferation within the host
                   genome. Several families in the human and mouse genomes
                   now consist of many hundreds of elements and, although
                   several candidates have been proposed, the mechanism
                   behind this proliferation has remained uncertain. To
                   investigate this mechanism, we reconstructed the ratio
                   of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes and the
                   acquisition of stop codons during the evolution of the
                   human ERV family HERV-K(HML2). We show that all genes,
                   including the env gene, which is necessary only for
                   movement between cells, have been under continuous
                   purifying selection. This finding strongly suggests
                   that the proliferation of this family has been almost
                   entirely due to germ-line reinfection, rather than
                   retrotransposition in cis or complementation in trans,
                   and that an infectious pool of endogenous retroviruses
                   has persisted within the primate lineage throughout the
                   past 30 million years. Because many elements within
                   this pool would have been unfixed, it is possible that
                   the HERV-K(HML2) family still contains infectious
                   elements at present, despite their apparent absence in
                   the human genome sequence. Analysis of the env gene of
                   eight other HERV families indicated that reinfection is
                   likely to be the most common mechanism by which
                   endogenous retroviruses proliferate in their hosts.},

                   current focus is shifting toward the effect of Alu
                   elements on evolution of the human genome. Recent
                   analyses indicate that numerous factors have affected
                   the chromosomal distribution of Alu elements over time,
                   including male-driven insertions, deletions and rapid
                   CpG mutations after their retrotransposition. Unequal
                   crossing over between Alu elements can lead to local
                   mutations or to large segmental duplications
                   responsible for genetic diseases and long-term
                   evolutionary changes. Alu elements can also affect
                   human (primate) evolution by introducing alternative
                   splice sites in existing genes. Studying the Alu family

  abstract       = {Alu and L1 are families of non-LTR retrotransposons
                   representing approximately equal 30\% of the human
                   genome. Genomic distributions of young Alu and L1
                   elements are quite similar, but over time, Alu
                   densities in GC-rich DNA increase in comparison with L1
                   densities. Here we analyze two processes that may
                   contribute to this phenomenon. First, DNA duplications
                   in the human genome occur more frequently in Alu- and
                   GC-rich than in AT-rich chromosomal regions. Second,
                   most Alu elements tend to be coclustered with each
                   other, but recently retroposed elements are likely to
                   be inserted outside the existing clusters. These
                   "stand-alone" elements appear to be rapidly eliminated
                   from the genome. We also report that over time, the
                   densities of recently retroposed Alu families on
                   chromosome Y decline rapidly, whereas Alu densities on
                   chromosome X increase relative to autosomal densities.
                   We propose that these changes in the chromosomal
                   proportions of Alu densities and the elimination of
                   stand-alone Alus represent the same process of paternal
                   Alu selection. We also propose that long-term Alu
                   accumulation in GC-rich DNA is associated with DNA
                   duplication initiated by elevated recombinogenic
                   activities in Alu clusters.},

                   Many of these elements have coding capacity for
                   transposases, which are related to each other and to
                   those encoded by the IS1016 group of bacterial
                   insertion sequences. Although these transposases
                   display a motif similar to the DDE motif found in many
                   transposases and integrases, they cannot be directly
                   allied to any of the previously described eukaryotic
                   transposases. Other common features of the new
                   eukaryotic and bacterial transposons include
                   similarities in their terminal inverted repeats and
                   8-bp or 9-bp target-site duplications. Together, these

  abstract       = {The concept that an insect species' genome could be
                   altered in a manner that would result in the control of
                   that species (i.e., autocidal control) or in the
                   replacement of a pestiferous strain of the species with
                   a more benign genotype was first proposed in the
                   mid-twentieth century. A major research effort in
                   population genetics and ecology followed and led to the
                   development of a set of classical genetic control
                   approaches that included use of sterile males,
                   conditional lethal genes, translocations, compound
                   chromosomes, and microbe-mediated infertility. Although
                   there have been a number of major successes in
                   application of classical genetic control, research in
                   this area has declined in the past 20 years for
                   technical and societal reasons. Recent advances in
                   molecular biology and transgenesis research have
                   renewed interest in genetically based control methods
                   because these advances may remove some major technical
                   problems that have constrained effective genetic
                   manipulation of pest species. Population genetic
                   analyses suggest that transgenic manipulations may
                   enable development of strains that would be 10 to over
                   100 times more efficient than strains developed by
                   classical methods. Some of the proposed molecular
                   approaches to genetic control involve modifications of
                   classical approaches such as conditional lethality,
                   whereas others are novel. Experience from the classical
                   era of genetic control research indicates that the
                   population structure and population dynamics of the
                   target population will determine which, if any, genetic
                   control approaches would be appropriate for addressing
                   a specific problem. As such, there continues to be a
                   need for ongoing communication between scientists who
                   are developing strains and those who study the native
                   pest populations.},

                   refractory to the transmission of human diseases such
                   as malaria, dengue, and yellow fever has received much
                   interest due to the ability to transform a number of
                   vector mosquito species with transposable elements.
                   Transgenic strains of mosquitoes have been generated
                   with molecular techniques that exhibit a reduced
                   capacity to transmit pathogens. These advancements have
                   led to questions regarding the fitness of transgenic
                   mosquitoes and the ability of transformed mosquitoes to
                   compete and effectively spread beneficial genes through
                   nontransformed field populations, the core requirement
                   of a genetically based control strategy aimed at
                   reducing the spread of mosquito-borne human disease.
                   Here we examine the impact of transgenesis on the
                   fitness of Aedes aegypti, a mosquito that transmits
                   yellow fever. Mosquitoes were altered with two types of
                   transgene, the enhanced GFP gene and two transposase
                   genes from the Hermes and MOS1 transposable elements.
                   We examined the effects of these elements on the
                   survivorship, longevity, fecundity, sex ratio, and
                   sterility of transformed mosquitoes and compared
                   results to the nontransformed laboratory strain. We
                   show that demographic parameters are significantly
                   diminished in transgenic mosquitoes relative to the
                   untransformed laboratory strain. Reduced fitness in
                   transgenic mosquitoes has important implications for
                   the development and utilization of this technology for
                   control programs based on manipulative molecular
                   modification.},

  abstract       = {One potential strategy for the control of malaria and
                   other vector-borne diseases is the introduction into
                   wild vector populations of genetic constructs that
                   reduce vectorial capacity. An important caveat of this
                   approach is that the genetic construct should have
                   minimal fitness cost to the transformed vector.
                   Previously, we produced transgenic Anopheles stephensi
                   expressing either of two effector genes, a tetramer of
                   the SM1 dodecapeptide or the phospholipase A2 gene
                   (PLA2) from honeybee venom. Mosquitoes carrying either
                   of these transgenes were impaired for Plasmodium
                   berghei transmission. We have investigated the role of
                   two effector genes for malaria parasite blockage in
                   terms of the fitness imposed to the mosquito vector
                   that expresses either molecule. By measuring mosquito
                   survival, fecundity, fertility, and by running
                   population cage experiments, we found that mosquitoes
                   transformed with the SM1 construct showed no
                   significant reduction in these fitness parameters
                   relative to nontransgenic controls. The PLA2
                   transgenics, however, had reduced fitness that seemed
                   to be independent of the insertion site of the
                   transgene. We conclude that the fitness load imposed by
                   refractory gene(s)-expressing mosquitoes depends on the
                   effect of the transgenic protein produced in that
                   mosquito. These results have important implications for
                   implementation of malaria control via genetic
                   modification of mosquitoes.},

  abstract       = {Experimenta naturae, like the glucose-6-phosphate
                   dehydrogenase deficiency, indicate that malaria
                   parasites are highly susceptible to alterations in the
                   redox equilibrium. This offers a great potential for
                   the development of urgently required novel
                   chemotherapeutic strategies. However, the relationship
                   between the redox status of malarial parasites and that
                   of their host is complex. In this review article we
                   summarise the presently available knowledge on sources
                   and detoxification pathways of reactive oxygen species
                   in malaria parasite-infected red cells, on clinical
                   aspects of redox metabolism and redox-related
                   mechanisms of drug action as well as future prospects
                   for drug development. As delineated below, alterations
                   in redox status contribute to disease manifestation
                   including sequestration, cerebral pathology, anaemia,
                   respiratory distress, and placental malaria. Studying
                   haemoglobinopathies, like thalassemias and sickle cell
                   disease, and other red cell defects that provide
                   protection against malaria allows insights into this
                   fine balance of redox interactions. The host immune
                   response to malaria involves phagocytosis as well as
                   the production of nitric oxide and oxygen radicals that
                   form part of the host defence system and also
                   contribute to the pathology of the disease. Haemoglobin
                   degradation by the malarial parasite produces the redox
                   active by-products, free haem and H(2)O(2), conferring
                   oxidative insult on the host cell. However, the
                   parasite also supplies antioxidant moieties to the host
                   and possesses an efficient enzymatic antioxidant
                   defence system including glutathione- and
                   thioredoxin-dependent proteins. Mechanistic and
                   structural work on these enzymes might provide a basis
                   for targeting the parasite. Indeed, a number of
                   currently used drugs, especially the endoperoxide
                   antimalarials, appear to act by increasing oxidant
                   stress, and novel drugs such as peroxidic compounds and
                   anthroquinones are being developed.},

                   (MITEs) are short, nonautonomous DNA elements that are
                   widespread and abundant in plant genomes. Most of the
                   hundreds of thousands of MITEs identified to date have
                   been divided into two major groups on the basis of
                   shared structural and sequence characteristics:
                   Tourist-like and Stowaway-like. Since MITEs have no
                   coding capacity, they must rely on transposases encoded
                   by other elements. Two active transposons, the maize P
                   Instability Factor (PIF) and the rice Pong element,
                   have recently been implicated as sources of transposase
                   for Tourist-like MITEs. Here we report that PIF- and
                   Pong-like elements are widespread, diverse, and
                   abundant in eukaryotes with hundreds of
                   element-associated transposases found in a variety of
                   plant, animal, and fungal genomes. The availability of
                   virtually the entire rice genome sequence facilitated
                   the identification of all the PIF/Pong-like elements in
                   this organism and permitted a comprehensive analysis of
                   their relationship with Tourist-like MITEs. Taken
                   together, our results indicate that PIF and Pong are
                   founding members of a large eukaryotic transposon
                   superfamily and that members of this superfamily are
                   responsible for the origin and amplification of
                   Tourist-like MITEs.},

                   every organism in which they have been looked for. The
                   sequencing of large genomes, such as the human genome
                   and those of Drosophila, Arabidopsis, Caenorhabditis,
                   has also shown that they are a major constituent of
                   these genomes, accounting for 15\% of the genome of
                   Drosophila, 45\% of the human genome, and more than
                   70\% in some plants and amphibians. Compared with the
                   1\% of genomic DNA dedicated to protein-coding
                   sequences in the human genome, this has prompted
                   various researchers to suggest that the TEs and the
                   other repetitive sequences that constitute the
                   so-called "noncoding DNA", are where the most
                   stimulating discoveries will be made in the future
                   (Bromham, 2002). We are therefore getting further and
                   further from the original idea that this DNA was simply
                   "junk DNA", that owed its presence in the genome
                   entirely to its capacity for selfish transposition. Our
                   understanding of the structures of TEs, their
                   distribution along the genomes, their sequence and
                   insertion polymorphisms within genomes, and within and
                   between populations and species, their impact on genes
                   and on the regulatory mechanisms of genetic expression,
                   their effects on exon shuffling and other phenomena
                   that reshape the genome, and their impact on genome
                   size has increased dramatically in recent years. This
                   leads to a more general picture of the impact of TEs on
                   genomes, though many copies are still mainly selfish or
                   junk DNA. In this review we focus mainly on discoveries
                   made in Drosophila, but we also use information about
                   other genomes when this helps to elucidate the general
                   processes involved in the organization, plasticity, and

  abstract       = {In recent years, a number of phylogenetic methods have
                   been developed for estimating molecular rates and
                   divergence dates under models that relax the molecular
                   clock constraint by allowing rate change throughout the
                   tree. These methods are being used with increasing
                   frequency, but there have been few studies into their
                   accuracy. We tested the accuracy of several
                   relaxed-clock methods (penalized likelihood and
                   Bayesian inference using various models of rate change)
                   using nucleotide sequences simulated on a nine-taxon
                   tree. When the sequences evolved with a constant rate,
                   the methods were able to infer rates accurately, but
                   estimates were more precise when a molecular clock was
                   assumed. When the sequences evolved under a model of
                   auto-correlated rate change, rates were accurately
                   estimated using penalized likelihood and by Bayesian
                   inference using lognormal and exponential models of
                   rate change, while other models did not perform as
                   well. When the sequences evolved under a model of
                   uncorrelated rate change, only Bayesian inference using
                   an exponential rate model performed well. Collectively,
                   the results provide a strong recommendation for using
                   the exponential model of rate change if a conservative
                   approach to divergence time estimation is required. A
                   case study is presented in which we use a
                   simulation-based approach to examine the hypothesis of
                   elevated rates in the Cambrian period, and it is found
                   that these high rate estimates might be an artifact of
                   the rate estimation method. If this bias is present,
                   then the ages of metazoan divergences would be
                   systematically underestimated. The results of this
                   study have implications for studies of molecular rates
                   and divergence dates.},

                   introgression of antipathogen effector genes into
                   vector populations. It is anticipated that these genes,
                   if present at high enough frequencies, will impede
                   transmission of the target pathogens and result in
                   reduced human morbidity and mortality. Recent
                   laboratory successes in the development of virus- and
                   protozoan-resistant mosquito strains make urgent
                   research of gene drive systems capable of moving
                   effector genes into wild populations. A systematic

                   developing world, the concept of implementation of new
                   strategies such as the use of genetically modified
                   mosquitoes to control the disease continues to gain
                   support. In Africa, which suffers most from malaria,
                   mosquito vector populations are spread almost
                   throughout the entire continent, and the parasite
                   reservoir is big and continuously increasing. Moreover,
                   malaria is transmitted by many species of anophelines
                   with specific seasonal and geographical patterns.
                   Therefore, a well designed, evolutionarily robust and
                   publicly accepted plan aiming at population reduction
                   or replacement is required. The task is twofold: to
                   engineer mosquitoes with a genetic trait that confers
                   resistance to malaria or causes population suppression;
                   and, to drive the new trait through field populations.
                   This review examines these two issues, and describes
                   the groundwork that has been done towards understanding
                   of the complex relation between the parasite and its

                   (TEs) according to Wright's island and continent-island
                   models, assuming that selection tends to counter the
                   deleterious effects of TEs. We showed that migration
                   between host populations has no impact on either the
                   existence or the stability of the TE copy number
                   equilibrium points obtained in the absence of
                   migration. However, if the migration rate is slower
                   than the transposition rate or if selection is weak,
                   then the TE copy numbers in all the populations can be
                   expected to slowly become homogeneous, whereas a
                   heterogeneous TE copy number distribution between
                   populations is maintained if TEs are mobilized in some
                   populations. The mean TE copy number is highly
                   sensitive to the population size, but as a result of
                   migration between populations, it decreases as the sum
                   of the population sizes increases and tends to reach
                   the same value in these populations. We have
                   demonstrated the existence of repulsion between TE
                   insertion sites, which is established by selection and
                   amplified by drift. This repulsion is reduced as much
                   as the migration rate is higher than the recombination
                   rate between the TE insertion sites. Migration and
                   demographic history are therefore strong forces in
                   determining the dynamics of TEs within the genomes and
                   the populations of a species.},

                   tools for genetically manipulating a wide variety of
                   plants, animals, and microbes. Some have suggested that
                   they could be used to spread desirable genes, such as
                   refractoriness to Plasmodium infection, through target
                   populations of Anopheles gambiae, thereby disabling the
                   mosquito's ability to transmit malaria. To achieve
                   this, a transposon must remain mobile and intact after
                   the initial introduction into the genome. Endogenous,
                   active class II transposable elements from An. gambiae
                   have not been exploited as gene vectors/drivers because
                   none have been isolated. We report the discovery of an
                   active class II transposable element, Herves, from the
                   mosquito An. gambiae. Herves is a member of a distinct
                   subfamily of hAT elements that includes the hopper-we
                   element from Bactrocera dorsalis and B. cucurbitae.
                   Herves was transpositionally active in mobility assays
                   performed in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells and
                   developing embryos and was used as a germ-line
                   transformation vector in D. melanogaster. Herves
                   displays an altered target-site preference from the
                   distantly related hAT elements, Hermes and hobo. Herves
                   is also present in An. arabiensis and An. merus with
                   copy numbers similar to that found in An. gambiae.
                   Preliminary data from an East African population are
                   consistent with the element being transpositionally
                   active in mosquitoes.},

                   on a prespecified parametric model of demographic
                   history. We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo
                   sampling procedure that efficiently samples a variant
                   of the generalized skyline plot, given sequence data,
                   and combines these plots to generate a posterior

                   We apply the Bayesian skyline plot to simulated data

                   demographic history under canonical scenarios. Finally,

  abstract       = {Studies of molecular evolutionary rates have yielded a
                   wide range of rate estimates for various genes and
                   taxa. Recent studies based on population-level and
                   pedigree data have produced remarkably high estimates
                   of mutation rate, which strongly contrast with
                   substitution rates inferred in phylogenetic
                   (species-level) studies. Using Bayesian analysis with a
                   relaxed-clock model, we estimated rates for three
                   groups of mitochondrial data: avian protein-coding
                   genes, primate protein-coding genes, and primate d-loop
                   sequences. In all three cases, we found a measurable
                   transition between the high, short-term (< 1-2 Myr)
                   mutation rate and the low, long-term substitution rate.
                   The relationship between the age of the calibration and
                   the rate of change can be described by a vertically
                   translated exponential decay curve, which may be used
                   for correcting molecular date estimates. The
                   phylogenetic substitution rates in mitochondria are
                   approximately 0.5\% per million years for avian
                   protein-coding sequences and 1.5\% per million years
                   for primate protein-coding and d-loop sequences.
                   Further analyses showed that purifying selection offers
                   the most convincing explanation for the observed
                   relationship between the estimated rate and the depth
                   of the calibration. We rule out the possibility that it
                   is a spurious result arising from sequence errors, and
                   find it unlikely that the apparent decline in rates
                   over time is caused by mutational saturation. Using a
                   rate curve estimated from the d-loop data, several
                   dates for last common ancestors were calculated: modern
                   humans and Neandertals (354 ka; 222-705 ka),
                   Neandertals (108 ka; 70-156 ka), and modern humans (76
                   ka; 47-110 ka). If the rate curve for a particular
                   taxonomic group can be accurately estimated, it can be
                   a useful tool for correcting divergence date estimates
                   by taking the rate decay into account. Our results show
                   that it is invalid to extrapolate molecular rates of
                   change across different evolutionary timescales, which
                   has important consequences for studies of populations,
                   domestication, conservation genetics, and human
                   evolution.},

                   Y-chromosome). It is assumed that any male carrying at
                   least one copy of the SD allele produces only
                   genotypically male offspring. In the second approach
                   (denoted PM), the inserted allele alters sex ratio by
                   causing genetically female individuals to become
                   phenotypically male. It is assumed that any insect
                   carrying at least one copy of the PM allele is
                   phenotypically male. Both approaches reduce future
                   population growth by reducing the number of phenotypic
                   females. The models allow variation in the number of
                   loci used in the release, the size of the release, and
                   the negative fitness effect caused by insertion of each
                   sex ratio altering allele. We show that such releases
                   may be at least 2 orders of magnitude more effective
                   than sterile male releases (SIT) in terms of numbers of
                   surviving insects. For example, a single SD release
                   with two released insects for every wild insect and a
                   5\% fitness cost per inserted allele could reduce the
                   target population to 1/1000th of the no-release
                   population size, whereas a similar-sized SIT release
                   would only reduce the population to one-fifth of its
                   original size. We also compare these two sex ratio
                   alteration approaches to a female-killing (FK) system
                   and the sterile male technique when there are repeated
                   releases over a number of generations. In these
                   comparisons, the SD approach is the most efficient with
                   equivalent pest suppression achieved by release of
                   approximately 1 SD, 1.5-20 PM, 2-70 FK, and 16-3,000
                   SIT insects, depending on conditions. We also calculate
                   the optimal number of SD and PM allele insertions to be
                   used under various conditions, assuming that there is
                   an additional genetic load incurred for each allelic
                   insertion.},

                   in all organisms in which they have been looked for,
                   the ways in which they invade genomes and populations
                   are still a matter of debate. By extending the
                   classical models of population genetics, several
                   approaches have been developed to account for the
                   dynamics of TEs, especially in Drosophila melanogaster
                   . While the formalism of these models is based on
                   simplifications, they enable us to understand better
                   how TEs invade genomes, as a result of multiple
                   evolutionary forces including duplication, deletion,
                   self-regulation, natural selection and genetic drift.
                   The aim of this paper is to review the assumptions and
                   the predictions of these different models by
                   highlighting the importance of the specific
                   characteristics of both the TEs and the hosts, and the
                   host/TE relationships. Then, perspectives in this

                   genomic localization in higher eukaryotes. For the
                   applied use of transgenic organisms as producers of
                   pharmaceutically relevant proteins or as pest
                   population control agents, a method to make transgene
                   expression predictable is highly desirable. A targeting
                   method that allows precise cassette replacement
                   comprising solely genes of interest (without extraneous
                   donor vector sequences) would be highly advantageous
                   for insects and other multicellular organisms. In this
                   report, we describe a method for transgene targeting to
                   predefined chromosomal sites in Drosophila by using a
                   transposon vector that, once integrated in the germ
                   line, acts as an acceptor site for donor vectors. To
                   make recombinational insertions irreversible, a FLP
                   recombinase-mediated cassette exchange strategy was
                   used, and to enhance donor-target pairing, a homing
                   sequence from the linotte locus was used. Site-specific
                   recombinants were screened by interconvertible eye
                   fluorescence marker phenotypes yielding, on average,
                   targeted insertions at a frequency of 23\%. The
                   cassette exchange system provides for repetitive
                   integrations into the same locus, allowing comparative
                   analysis of true transgenic alleles. Furthermore, this
                   method was used to stabilize a targeted transgene by
                   the postintegration excision of putatively mobile
                   transposon sequences. The genomic targeting and
                   stabilization strategy described for Drosophila should
                   be applicable to other insects, specifically for the
                   goals of optimizing heterologous protein expression and
                   enhancing ecological safety of transgenic strains

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Two central problems in computational
                   biology are the determination of the alignment and
                   phylogeny of a set of biological sequences. The
                   traditional approach to this problem is to first build
                   a multiple alignment of these sequences, followed by a
                   phylogenetic reconstruction step based on this multiple
                   alignment. However, alignment and phylogenetic
                   inference are fundamentally interdependent, and
                   ignoring this fact leads to biased and overconfident
                   estimations. Whether the main interest be in sequence
                   alignment or phylogeny, a major goal of computational
                   biology is the co-estimation of both. RESULTS: We
                   developed a fully Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
                   method for coestimating phylogeny and sequence
                   alignment, under the Thorne-Kishino-Felsenstein model
                   of substitution and single nucleotide
                   insertion-deletion (indel) events. In our earlier work,
                   we introduced a novel and efficient algorithm, termed
                   the "indel peeling algorithm", which includes indels as
                   phylogenetically informative evolutionary events, and
                   resembles Felsenstein's peeling algorithm for
                   substitutions on a phylogenetic tree. For a fixed
                   alignment, our extension analytically integrates out
                   both substitution and indel events within a proper
                   statistical model, without the need for data
                   augmentation at internal tree nodes, allowing for
                   efficient sampling of tree topologies and edge lengths.
                   To additionally sample multiple alignments, we here
                   introduce an efficient partial Metropolized
                   independence sampler for alignments, and combine these
                   two algorithms into a fully Bayesian co-estimation
                   procedure for the alignment and phylogeny problem. Our
                   approach results in estimates for the posterior
                   distribution of evolutionary rate parameters, for the
                   maximum a-posteriori (MAP) phylogenetic tree, and for
                   the posterior decoding alignment. Estimates for the
                   evolutionary tree and multiple alignment are augmented
                   with confidence estimates for each node height and
                   alignment column. Our results indicate that the
                   patterns in reliability broadly correspond to
                   structural features of the proteins, and thus provides
                   biologically meaningful information which is not
                   existent in the usual point-estimate of the alignment.
                   Our methods can handle input data of moderate size
                   (10-20 protein sequences, each 100-200 bp), which we
                   analyzed overnight on a standard 2 GHz personal
                   computer. CONCLUSION: Joint analysis of multiple
                   sequence alignment, evolutionary trees and additional
                   evolutionary parameters can be now done within a single
                   coherent statistical framework.},

  abstract       = {There are clear theoretical reasons and many
                   well-documented examples which show that repetitive,
                   DNA is essential for genome function. Generic repeated
                   signals in the DNA are necessary to format expression
                   of unique coding sequence files and to organise
                   additional functions essential for genome replication
                   and accurate transmission to progeny cells. Repetitive
                   DNA sequence elements are also fundamental to the
                   cooperative molecular interactions forming
                   nucleoprotein complexes. Here, we review the surprising
                   abundance of repetitive DNA in many genomes, describe
                   its structural diversity, and discuss dozens of cases
                   where the functional importance of repetitive elements
                   has been studied in molecular detail. In particular,
                   the fact that repeat elements serve either as
                   initiators or boundaries for heterochromatin domains
                   and provide a significant fraction of
                   scaffolding/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) suggests
                   that the repetitive component of the genome plays a
                   major architectonic role in higher order physical
                   structuring. Employing an information science model,
                   the 'functionalist' perspective on repetitive DNA leads
                   to new ways of thinking about the systemic organisation
                   of cellular genomes and provides several novel
                   possibilities involving repeat elements in
                   evolutionarily significant genome reorganisation. These
                   ideas may facilitate the interpretation of comparisons
                   between sequenced genomes, where the repetitive DNA
                   component is often greater than the coding sequence
                   component.},

                   useful to revisit some basic concepts and assumptions

                   among these observations are the complex modularity of

                   to model genetic variation in a population.
                   Specifically, it allows inference about population
                   parameters from sampled DNA sequences. However, most
                   currently employed variants of coalescent theory only
                   consider very simple demographic scenarios of
                   population size changes, such as exponential growth.
                   RESULTS: Here we develop a coalescent approach that
                   allows Bayesian non-parametric estimation of the
                   demographic history using genealogies reconstructed
                   from sampled DNA sequences. In this framework inference
                   and model selection is done using reversible jump
                   Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This method is
                   computationally efficient and overcomes the limitations
                   of related non-parametric approaches such as the
                   skyline plot. We validate the approach using simulated
                   data. Subsequently, we reanalyze HIV-1 sequence data
                   from Central Africa and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) data
                   from Egypt. CONCLUSIONS: The new method provides a
                   Bayesian procedure for non-parametric estimation of the
                   demographic history. By construction it additionally
                   provides confidence limits and may be used jointly with
                   other MCMC-based coalescent approaches.},

  abstract       = {Mariner-like elements (MLEs) are DNA transposons found
                   throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. A previous
                   computational survey of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome
                   sequence revealed 34 full length MLEs (Osmars)
                   belonging to 25 distinct families. This survey, which
                   also identified sequence similarities between the Osmar
                   elements and the Stowaway superfamily of MITEs, led to
                   the formulation of a hypothesis whereby Stowaways are
                   mobilized by OSMAR transposases. Here we investigate
                   the DNA-binding activities and specificities of two
                   OSMAR transposases, OSMAR5 and OSMAR10. Like other
                   mariner-like transposases, the OSMARs bind specifically
                   to the terminal inverted repeat (TIR) sequences of
                   their encoding transposons. OSMAR5 binds DNA through a
                   bipartite N-terminal domain containing two functionally
                   separable helix-turn-helix motifs, resembling the
                   paired domain of Tc1-like transposases and PAX
                   transcription factors in metazoans. Furthermore,
                   binding of the OSMARs is not limited to their own TIRs;
                   OSMAR5 transposase can also interact in vitro with TIRs
                   from closely related Osmar elements and with consensus
                   TIRs of several Stowaway families mined from the rice
                   genome sequence. These results provide the first
                   biochemical evidence for a functional relationship
                   between Osmar elements and Stowaway MITEs and lead us
                   to suggest that there is extensive cross-talk among
                   related but distinct transposon families co-existing in
                   a single eukaryote genome.},

                   within the mosquito vector at the molecular level
                   should provide novel targets for interrupting parasitic
                   life cycle and subsequent transmission. Availability of
                   the complete genomic sequence of the major African
                   malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, allows discovery of
                   such targets through experimental as well as
                   computational methods. In the female mosquito, the
                   salivary gland tissue plays an important role in the
                   maturation of the infective form of the malaria
                   parasite. Therefore, we carried out a proteomic
                   analysis of salivary glands from female An. gambiae
                   mosquitoes. Salivary gland extracts were digested with
                   trypsin using two complementary approaches and analyzed
                   by LC-MS/MS. This led to identification of 69 unique
                   proteins, 57 of which were novel. We carried out a
                   functional annotation of all proteins identified in
                   this study through a detailed bioinformatics analysis.

                   describing the application of MS for characterization
                   of the salivary gland proteome. Our approach should
                   prove valuable for characterizing proteomes of
                   parasites and vectors with sequenced genomes as well as
                   those whose genomes are yet to be fully sequenced.},

                   generally both found in most eukaryotes. These two
                   classes of elements are usually distinguished on the
                   basis of their differing mechanisms of transposition.
                   However, their respective frequencies, their
                   intragenomic dynamics and distributions, and the
                   frequencies of their horizontal transfer from one
                   species to another can also differ. The main objective
                   of this review is to compare these two types of
                   elements from a new perspective, using data provided by
                   genome sequencing projects and relating this to the
                   theoretical and observed dynamics. It is shown that the
                   traditional division into two classes, based on the
                   transposition mechanisms, becomes less obvious when
                   other factors are taken into consideration. A great
                   diversity in distribution and dynamics within each
                   class is observed. In contrast, the impact on and the
                   interactions with the genome can show striking
                   similarities between families of the two classes.},

                   species. DNA-based elements (class II elements),
                   non-LTR retrotransposons (class I elements), and MITEs
                   (Miniature Inverted Repeat Transposable Elements) are
                   found in the three genera, Anopheles, Aedes and Culex,
                   whereas LTR retrotransposons (class I elements) are
                   found only in Anopheles and Aedes. Mosquitoes were the
                   first insects in which MITEs were reported; they have
                   several LTR retrotransposons belonging to the Pao
                   family, which is distinct from the Gypsy-Ty3 and
                   Copia-Ty1 families. The number of TE copies shows huge
                   variations between classes of TEs within a given
                   species (from 1 to 1000), in sharp contrast to
                   Drosophila, which shows only relatively minor
                   differences in copy number between elements (from 1 to
                   100). The genomes of these insects therefore display
                   major differences in the amount of TEs and therefore in
                   their structure and global composition. We emphasize
                   the need for more population genetic data about the
                   activity of TEs, their distribution over chromosomes
                   and their frequencies in natural populations of
                   mosquitoes, to further the current attempts to develop
                   a transgenic mosquito unable to transmit malaria that
                   is intended to replace the natural populations.},

                   alignments and the phylogenetic trees that relate the
                   sequences. Unlike current techniques that base
                   phylogeny estimates on a single estimate of the
                   alignment, we take alignment uncertainty into account
                   by considering all possible alignments. Furthermore,
                   because the alignment and phylogeny are constructed
                   simultaneously, a guide tree is not needed. This
                   sidesteps the problem in which alignments created by
                   progressive alignment are biased toward the guide tree
                   used to generate them. Joint estimation also allows us
                   to model rate variation between sites when estimating
                   the alignment and to use the evidence in shared
                   insertion/deletions (indels) to group sister taxa in
                   the phylogeny. Our indel model makes use of affine gap
                   penalties and considers indels of multiple letters. We
                   make the simplifying assumption that the indel process
                   is identical on all branches. As a result, the
                   probability of a gap is independent of branch length.
                   We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to
                   sample from the posterior of the joint model,
                   estimating the most probable alignment and tree and
                   their support simultaneously. We describe a new MCMC
                   transition kernel that improves our algorithm's mixing
                   efficiency, allowing the MCMC chains to converge even
                   when started from arbitrary alignments. Our software
                   implementation can estimate alignment uncertainty and
                   we describe a method for summarizing this uncertainty
                   in a single plot.},

                   DNA sequences able to invade the genome of their host
                   species. Their evolutive dynamics are complex, due to
                   the interaction between their intrinsic amplification
                   capacity, selection at the host level, transposition
                   regulation, and genetic drift. Here, we propose
                   modeling the first steps of TE invasion, i.e., just
                   after a horizontal transfer, when a single copy is
                   present in the genome of one individual. If the element
                   has a constant transposition rate, it will disappear in
                   most cases: the elements with low-transposition rate
                   are frequently lost through genetic drift, while those
                   with high-transposition rate may amplify, leading to
                   the sterility of their host. Elements whose
                   transposition rate is regulated are able to
                   successfully invade the populations, thanks to an
                   initial transposition burst followed by a strong
                   limitation of their activity. Self-regulation or hybrid
                   dysgenesis may thus represent some genome-invasion

                   overall architecture of the human genome. Currently,
                   there are three lineages of retrotransposons (Alu, L1,
                   and SVA) that are believed to be actively replicating
                   in humans. While estimates of their copy number,
                   sequence diversity, and levels of insertion
                   polymorphism can readily be obtained from existing
                   genomic sequence data and population sampling, a
                   detailed understanding of the temporal pattern of
                   retrotransposon amplification remains elusive. Here we
                   pose the question of whether, using genomic sequence
                   and population frequency data from extant taxa, one can
                   adequately reconstruct historical amplification
                   patterns. To this end, we developed a computer
                   simulation that incorporates several known aspects of
                   primate Alu retrotransposon biology and accommodates
                   sampling effects resulting from the methods by which
                   mobile elements are typically discovered and
                   characterized. By modeling a number of amplification
                   scenarios and comparing simulation-generated
                   expectations to empirical data gathered from existing
                   Alu subfamilies, we were able to statistically reject a
                   number of amplification scenarios for individual
                   subfamilies, including that of a rapid expansion or
                   explosion of Alu amplification at the time of

  abstract       = {Some vector-borne disease control strategies using
                   transgenic mosquitoes require transgene spread to high
                   frequency in populations. Transposable elements (TEs)
                   are DNA sequences that replicate and transpose within
                   the genomes of other organisms and may therefore be
                   represented in the next generation in higher
                   frequencies than predicted by Mendelian segregation.
                   This over-representation has allowed some TEs to spread
                   through natural populations. Transgenes incorporated
                   within a TE sequence are expected to be driven into
                   populations as long as there is a positive balance
                   between fitness costs and over-representation. Models
                   have been used to examine parameters that affect this
                   balance but did not take into account biased insertion
                   of TEs to linked sites in the genome. A simulation
                   model was created to examine the impact of insertion
                   bias on TE spread in mosquito populations. TEs that
                   induce no fitness costs are predicted to increase in
                   frequency over a wide range of parameter values but
                   spread is slower for lower levels of transposition and
                   non-local movement. If TEs are costly, high proportions
                   of local movement can slow or halt spread. To function
                   as a robust transgene drive mechanism a TE should
                   replicate and transpose > 10\%/insert/generation,
                   induce < 1\% fitness cost/insert, and move
                   preferentially to unlinked sites in the genome.},

                   Transposable Element Simulator Dynamics, a population

                   developed to provide a simple tool for analyzing the
                   dynamics of TEs in a community based on (i) various TE

                   rates. The simulations can be used to illustrate the
                   dynamic fate of TEs in structured populations, can be
                   extended by using more specific molecular or

                   Alternative models, in which multiple source sequences
                   are simultaneously active, have been called "transposon

                   elements that are active and in whether inactivation
                   occurs at the moment of transposition or later. Here we

                   Indeed, transgenic insects often show lower fitness
                   than wild individuals, and the transgene does not seem
                   able to spread through a natural population without a
                   driving system. The use of remobilizable vectors, based
                   on the invading properties of transposable elements,
                   has been frequently suggested. Simulations show that
                   this strategy can be efficient. Moreover, if the
                   transgene is designed to use transposition machinery
                   already present in the genome, the transgene invasion
                   appears to be potentially reversible after a few

                   large fraction of the genome. However, while the
                   changes in genome size observed at a wide taxonomic
                   level have been thoroughly investigated, we still know
                   little about the process involved in closely related
                   species. We estimated genome sizes and the reverse
                   transcriptase-related sequence (RTRS) content in the
                   nine species of the Drosophila melanogaster species
                   subgroup. We showed that the species differ with regard
                   to their genome size and that the RTRS content is
                   correlated with genome size for all species except
                   Drosophila orena. The genome of D. orena, which is
                   1.6-fold as big as that of D. melanogaster, has in fact
                   not undergone any major increase in its RTRS content.},

  abstract       = {The endosymbiotic bacteria in the genus Wolbachia are
                   capable of inducing a wide range of reproductive
                   abnormalities in their hosts, including cytoplasmic
                   incompatibility (CI), which could lead to the
                   replacement of uninfected host populations with
                   infected ones. Because of this, Wolbachia have
                   attracted considerable interest as a potential
                   mechanism for spreading disease-blocking transgenes
                   through vector populations. Here we report the
                   establishment of double Wolbachia transinfection by
                   direct adult microinjection of Wolbachia from naturally
                   double-infected Aedes albopictus to Aedes aegypti, the
                   most important mosquito vector of infectious viral
                   diseases, and a mosquito in which natural Wolbachia
                   infections are not known to occur. We further
                   demonstrate that incomplete CI is induced in these
                   double-transinfected mosquitoes. Comparisons of fitness
                   traits between naturally uninfected and transinfected
                   Ae. aegypti lines indicated one significant difference
                   in favor of the latter, namely, an increased number of
                   eggs laid. Levels of CI expression corresponded to the
                   Wolbachia density. There were large differences in
                   relative Wolbachia density between reproductive and
                   nonreproductive tissues in both Ae. albopictus and
                   transinfected Ae. aegypti, except Malpighian tubule,
                   which implied the preferred establishment of Wolbachia
                   within reproductive tissue. Results from a simulation
                   model confirm that population replacement by
                   transinfected Ae. aegypti is possible over time. The
                   establishment of Wolbachia double infections in Ae.
                   aegypti by direct adult microinjection and the
                   demonstration of CI expression in this new host suggest
                   that Wolbachia could be experimentally transferred into
                   vector species and could also be used as a gene-driving
                   system to genetically manipulate vector populations.},

                   non-competent vectors has been proposed as a promising
                   alternative to conventional control strategies. Due to
                   likely fitness costs associated with vectors
                   manipulated to carry anti-pathogen effector genes, the
                   effector genes will need to be coupled with a strong
                   drive system to rapidly sweep them into natural
                   populations. Endogenous meiotic drive systems have
                   strong and stable population replacement potential, and
                   have previously been reported in two mosquito species:
                   Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens. To investigate the
                   influence of an endogenous meiotic drive gene on Ae.
                   aegypti population dynamics, we established three
                   experimental population types that were initiated with
                   100%, 10%, and 1% male mosquitoes carrying a strong
                   meiotic driver (T37 strain) and 100% sensitive females
                   (RED strain), respectively. Among the 100% and 10%
                   populations, early generations were highly male biased,
                   which reflected the effects of the meiotic driver, and
                   remained more than 60% male by the F(15). A genetic
                   marker tightly linked with the meiotic driver on
                   chromosome 1 showed strong selection for the T37
                   strain-specific allele. Similar but reduced effects of
                   the meiotic driver were also observed in the 1%
                   populations. These results suggest that release of Ae.
                   aegypti males carrying a strong meiotic driver into
                   drive sensitive populations can be an effective tool
                   for population replacement, and provide a foundation
                   for additional studies including both experimental
                   populations and simulations by mathematical modeling.},

                   the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a
                   continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic
                   inference, it is evident that both are biologically
                   unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies
                   between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate
                   models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been
                   described. These models open the gate to a new field of
                   "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new
                   approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis.
                   We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies
                   and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in
                   evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach
                   also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness
                   of datasets and comparing this measure between
                   different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant
                   rate autocorrelation among branches in three large
                   datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not
                   necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we
                   place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness
                   between a strict molecular clock and the alternative
                   unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102
                   bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500
                   primate alignments. From these we conclude that our
                   method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise
                   than the traditional unrooted model while adding the
                   ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

                   constructs that exhibit underdominance properties. Our
                   deterministic model includes two independently
                   segregating engineered constructs that both carry a
                   lethal gene, but suppress each other. Only genotypes
                   containing both or neither construct are viable. Both
                   constructs also carry the desired gene with an
                   independent regulatory mechanism. We examine the
                   minimal number of individuals of an engineered strain

                   strain increases. As fitness costs increase, the number
                   of individuals that must be released increases at a
                   greater rate for release strains with more insertions.
                   Under specific conditions this results in the strain
                   with only a single insertion of each construct being
                   the most efficient for introgressing the desired gene.

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Repbase is a reference database of
                   eukaryotic repetitive DNA, which includes prototypic
                   sequences of repeats and basic information described in
                   annotations. Updating and maintenance of the database
                   requires specialized tools, which we have created and
                   made available for use with Repbase, and which may be
                   useful as a template for other curated databases.
                   RESULTS: We describe the software tools
                   RepbaseSubmitter and Censor, which are designed to
                   facilitate updating and screening the content of
                   Repbase. RepbaseSubmitter is a java-based interface for
                   formatting and annotating Repbase entries. It
                   eliminates many common formatting errors, and automates
                   actions such as calculation of sequence lengths and
                   composition, thus facilitating curation of Repbase
                   sequences. In addition, it has several features for
                   predicting protein coding regions in sequences;
                   searching and including Pubmed references in Repbase
                   entries; and searching the NCBI taxonomy database for
                   correct inclusion of species information and taxonomic
                   position. Censor is a tool to rapidly identify
                   repetitive elements by comparison to known repeats. It
                   uses WU-BLAST for speed and sensitivity, and can
                   conduct DNA-DNA, DNA-protein, or translated
                   DNA-translated DNA searches of genomic sequence.
                   Defragmented output includes a map of repeats present
                   in the query sequence, with the options to report
                   masked query sequence(s), repeat sequences found in the
                   query, and alignments. CONCLUSION: Censor and
                   RepbaseSubmitter are available as both web-based
                   services and downloadable versions. They can be found

                   Indeed, transgenic insects often show lower fitness
                   than wild individuals, and the transgene does not seem
                   able to spread through a natural population without a
                   driving system. The use of remobilizable vectors, based
                   on the invading properties of transposable elements,
                   has been frequently suggested. Simulations show that
                   this strategy can be efficient. Moreover, if the
                   transgene is designed to use transposition machinery
                   already present in the genome, the transgene invasion
                   appears to be potentially reversible after a few

                   plasmodium species and Ross confirmed that they were
                   transmitted by female anopheline mosquitoes, malaria
                   remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
                   worldwide. Although the areas where transmission takes
                   place have reduced, and they are by now confined to the
                   inter tropical areas, the number of people living at
                   risk has grown to about 3 billion, and is expected to
                   go on increasing. Not only does malaria cause around
                   500 million cases every year, and between 1 and 3
                   million deaths, but it also carries a huge burden that
                   impairs the economic and social development of large
                   parts of the planet. The failed attempt to eradicate
                   malaria gave way to the control policy that was
                   followed by a huge resurgence of malaria during the
                   late 70s and 80s. Together with the emergence and
                   spread of resistance to chloroquine and the weak health
                   infrastructure in many of the endemic countries,
                   particularly in Africa, the malaria situation worsened
                   worldwide. The last decade of the 20th century was
                   witness to the international community becoming
                   increasingly aware of the unacceptable situation that
                   the burden of malaria represented to large parts of the
                   world. Renewed efforts to describe the problem, design
                   and evaluate new control strategies, design and develop
                   new drugs, better understand the biology of the
                   parasite and the immunity it induces in the human host,

                   accumulated through repeated copying from a single
                   source locus: the "master gene." The extent to which a

                   One repetitive element family for which a convincing
                   case for a master gene has been made is the rodent ID
                   (identifier) elements. Here we devise a new test of the

                   exclusion of codon-based models from commonly employed
                   model selection techniques, presumably due to the
                   computational cost associated with codon models. We
                   investigated an efficient alternative to standard
                   nucleotide substitution models, in which codon position
                   (CP) is incorporated into the model. We determined the
                   most appropriate model for alignments of 177 RNA virus
                   genes and 106 yeast genes, using 11 substitution models
                   including one codon model and four CP models. The
                   majority of analyzed gene alignments are best described
                   by CP substitution models, rather than by standard
                   nucleotide models, and without the computational cost
                   of full codon models. These results have significant
                   implications for phylogenetic inference of coding
                   sequences as they make it clear that substitution
                   models incorporating CPs not only are a computationally
                   realistic alternative to standard models but may also
                   frequently be statistically superior.},

                   of fundamental importance for many aspects of
                   evolution. We develop two methods for characterizing
                   the fitness effects of deleterious, nonsynonymous
                   mutations, using polymorphism data from two related
                   species. These methods also provide estimates of the
                   proportion of amino acid substitutions that are
                   selectively favorable, when combined with data on
                   between-species sequence divergence. The methods are
                   applicable to species with different effective
                   population sizes, but that share the same distribution
                   of mutational effects. The first, simpler, method
                   assumes that diversity for all nonneutral mutations is
                   given by the value under mutation-selection balance,
                   while the second method allows for stronger effects of
                   genetic drift and yields estimates of the parameters of
                   the probability distribution of mutational effects. We
                   apply these methods to data on populations of
                   Drosophila miranda and D. pseudoobscura and find
                   evidence for the presence of deleterious nonsynonymous
                   mutations, mostly with small heterozygous selection
                   coefficients (a mean of the order of 10(-5) for
                   segregating variants). A leptokurtic gamma distribution
                   of mutational effects with a shape parameter between
                   0.1 and 1 can explain observed diversities, in the
                   absence of a separate class of completely neutral
                   nonsynonymous mutations. We also describe a simple
                   approximate method for estimating the harmonic mean
                   selection coefficient from diversity data on a single
                   species.},

  abstract       = {The emergence of new genes and functions is of central
                   importance to the evolution of species. The
                   contribution of various types of duplications to
                   genetic innovation has been extensively investigated.
                   Less understood is the creation of new genes by
                   recycling of coding material from selfish mobile
                   genetic elements. To investigate this process, we
                   reconstructed the evolutionary history of SETMAR, a new
                   primate chimeric gene resulting from fusion of a SET
                   histone methyltransferase gene to the transposase gene
                   of a mobile element. We show that the transposase gene
                   was recruited as part of SETMAR 40-58 million years
                   ago, after the insertion of an Hsmar1 transposon
                   downstream of a preexisting SET gene, followed by the
                   de novo exonization of previously noncoding sequence
                   and the creation of a new intron. The original
                   structure of the fusion gene is conserved in all
                   anthropoid lineages, but only the N-terminal half of
                   the transposase is evolving under strong purifying
                   selection. In vitro assays show that this region
                   contains a DNA-binding domain that has preserved its
                   ancestral binding specificity for a 19-bp motif located
                   within the terminal-inverted repeats of Hsmar1
                   transposons and their derivatives. The presence of
                   these transposons in the human genome constitutes a
                   potential reservoir of approximately 1,500 perfect or
                   nearly perfect SETMAR-binding sites. Our results not
                   only provide insight into the conditions required for a
                   successful gene fusion, but they also suggest a
                   mechanism by which the circuitry underlying complex
                   regulatory networks may be rapidly established.},

                   elements capable of parasite-like proliferation in the
                   host genome. All known transposable elements in
                   eukaryotes belong to two types: retrotransposons and
                   DNA transposons. Here we report a previously
                   uncharacterized class of DNA transposons called
                   Polintons that populate genomes of protists, fungi, and
                   animals, including entamoeba, soybean rust, hydra, sea
                   anemone, nematodes, fruit flies, beetle, sea urchin,
                   sea squirt, fish, lizard, frog, and chicken. Polintons
                   from all these species are characterized by a unique
                   set of proteins necessary for their transposition,
                   including a protein-primed DNA polymerase B, retroviral
                   integrase, cysteine protease, and ATPase. In addition,
                   Polintons are characterized by 6-bp target site
                   duplications, terminal-inverted repeats that are
                   several hundred nucleotides long, and 5'-AG and TC-3'
                   termini. Analogously to known transposable elements,
                   Polintons exist as autonomous and nonautonomous
                   elements. Our data suggest that Polintons have evolved
                   from a linear plasmid that acquired a retroviral
                   integrase at least 1 billion years ago. According to
                   the model of Polinton transposition proposed here, a
                   Polinton DNA molecule excised from the genome serves as
                   a template for extrachromosomal synthesis of its
                   double-stranded DNA copy by the Polinton-encoded DNA
                   polymerase and is inserted back into genome by its
                   integrase.},

                   of genomes. Some copies are fully efficient; i.e., they
                   are able to produce the proteins needed for their own
                   transposition, and they can move and duplicate into the
                   genome. Other copies are mutated. They may have lost
                   their moving ability, their coding capacity, or both,
                   thus becoming pseudogenes slowly eliminated from the
                   genome through deletions and natural selection. Little
                   is known about the dynamics of such mutant elements,
                   particularly concerning their interactions with
                   autonomous copies. To get a better understanding of the
                   transposable elements' evolution after their initial
                   invasion, we have designed a population genetics model
                   of transposable elements dynamics including mutants or
                   nonfunctional sequences. We have particularly focused
                   on the case where these sequences are nonautonomous
                   elements, known to be able to use the transposition
                   machinery produced by the autonomous ones. The results
                   show that such copies generally prevent the system from
                   achieving a stable transposition-selection equilibrium
                   and that nonautonomous elements can invade the system
                   at the expense of autonomous ones. The resulting
                   dynamics are mainly cyclic, which highlights the
                   similarities existing between genomic selfish DNA
                   sequences and host-parasite systems.},

  abstract       = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and
                   the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a
                   continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic
                   inference, it is evident that both are biologically
                   unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies
                   between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate
                   models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been
                   described. These models open the gate to a new field of
                   "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new
                   approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis.
                   We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies
                   and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in
                   evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach
                   also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness
                   of datasets and comparing this measure between
                   different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant
                   rate autocorrelation among branches in three large
                   datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not
                   necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we
                   place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness
                   between a strict molecular clock and the alternative
                   unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102
                   bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500
                   primate alignments. From these we conclude that our
                   method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise
                   than the traditional unrooted model while adding the
                   ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

                   classification of transposable elements (TEs) as
                   'useless', 'selfish' or 'junk' pieces of DNA is not an
                   accurate one. TEs seem to have complex regulatory
                   functions and contribute to the coding regions of many
                   genes. Because this contribution had been documented
                   only at transcript level, we searched for evidence that
                   would also support the translation of TE cassettes. Our
                   findings suggest that the proportion of proteins with
                   TE-encoded fragments (approximately 0.1%), although
                   probably underestimated, is much less than what the
                   data at transcript level suggest (approximately 4%). In
                   all cases, the TE cassettes are derived from old TEs,
                   consistent with the idea that incorporation
                   (exaptation) of TE fragments into functional proteins
                   requires long evolutionary periods. We therefore argue
                   that functional proteins are unlikely to contain TE
                   cassettes derived from young TEs, the role of which is
                   probably limited to regulatory functions.},

                   genetically by the limited standing diversity of its
                   hemagglutinin and antigenically by clusters that emerge
                   and replace each other within 2 to 8 years. By
                   introducing an epidemiological model that allows for
                   differences between the genetic and antigenic
                   properties of the virus's hemagglutinin, we show that
                   these patterns can arise from cluster-specific immunity
                   alone. Central to the formulation is a
                   genotype-to-phenotype mapping, based on neutral
                   networks, with antigenic phenotypes, not genotypes,
                   determining the degree of strain cross-immunity. The
                   model parsimoniously explains well-known, as well as
                   previously unremarked, features of interpandemic
                   influenza dynamics and evolution. It captures the
                   observed boom-and-bust pattern of viral evolution, with
                   periods of antigenic stasis during which genetic
                   diversity grows, and with episodic contraction of this
                   diversity during cluster transitions.},

                   organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents
                   (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used
                   tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other
                   disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of
                   autonomous entities. However, there is no standard
                   protocol for describing such simulation models, which
                   can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate.
                   This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD,
                   for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by
                   28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within
                   ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks
                   (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are
                   subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State
                   variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling,
                   Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels.
                   We explain which aspects of a model should be described
                   in each element, and we present an example to
                   illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19
                   examples are available in an Online Appendix. We
                   consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more
                   detailed common format of the description of IBMs and
                   ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully
                   evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large
                   proportion of modellers.}},

  abstract       = {The reconstruction of the epidemic history of several
                   HIV populations, by using methods that infer the
                   population history from sampled gene sequence data, has
                   revealed important subtype-specific and
                   regional-specific differences in patterns of epidemic
                   growth. Here, we employ Bayesian coalescent-based
                   methods to compare the population history of the HIV-1
                   subtype B and F1 epidemics in Brazil from
                   non-contemporary env and pol gene sequences. Our
                   results suggest that after the introduction of the
                   subtypes B and F1 into Brazilian population, around mid
                   to late 1960s and late 1970s, respectively, these
                   subtypes experienced an initial period of exponential
                   growth with similar epidemic growth rates (
                   approximately 0.5-0.6year(-1)). Later, the spreading
                   rate of both subtypes seems to have slowed-down since
                   mid to late 1980s. This demographic pattern is very
                   similar to that reported for the subtype B epidemics in
                   high-income countries where HIV was initially
                   transmitted through homosexual intercourse and
                   injecting drug use, as in Brazil; suggesting that the
                   characteristics of transmission networks may be a key
                   determinant of the HIV epidemic growth pattern. It is
                   important to note that most of the subtype B and F1
                   sequences used in this study come from the Southeast
                   region that has been the most affected by the AIDS
                   epidemic in Brazil, being responsible for around 63\%
                   of all AIDS cases reported since the early eighties;
                   but may not represent the demographic trend of the
                   HIV-1 epidemic in other Brazilian regions.},

                   the family Picornaviridae. Previous studies suggested
                   that HAV may evolve more slowly than other members of
                   the family. To estimate HAV substitution rates
                   precisely, we used a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
                   (MCMC) approach on temporally sampled HAV VP1
                   full-length sequences from strains isolated in France.
                   A mean rate of evolutionary change of 9.76 x 10(-4)
                   nucleotide substitution per site per year was found.
                   The results also revealed that the synonymous rate
                   found for HAV is lower than that of other members of
                   the family. Bayesian skyline plots revealed a sharp
                   decline in the effective number of infections in 1996,
                   coinciding with the introduction of HAV vaccine.},

                   greatly improving our knowledge of the evolution of
                   human influenza virus at the epidemiological scale. In
                   particular, recent studies have revealed a more complex
                   relationship between antigenic evolution, natural
                   selection and reassortment than previously realized.
                   Despite these advances, there is much that remains to

                   virus, particularly the processes that determine the

  abstract       = {Rolling-circle (RC) transposons, or Helitrons, are a
                   newly recognized group of eukaryotic transposable
                   elements abundant in the genomes of plants,
                   invertebrates, and zebrafish. We provide evidence for
                   the colonization of a mammalian genome by Helitrons,
                   which has not been reported previously. We identified
                   and characterized two families of Helitrons in the
                   little brown bat Myotis lucifugus. The consensus
                   sequence for the first family, HeliBat1, displays the
                   hallmarks of an autonomous Helitron, including coding
                   capacity for an approximately 1,500-aa protein with an
                   RC replication motif and a region related to the SF1
                   superfamily of DNA helicases. The HeliBatN1 family is a
                   nonautonomous Helitron family that is only distantly
                   related to HeliBat1. The two HeliBat families have
                   attained high copy numbers (approximately 15,000 and >
                   100,000 copies, respectively) and make up at least
                   approximately 3\% of the M. lucifugus genome. Sequence
                   divergence and cross-species analyses indicate that
                   both HeliBat families have amplified within the last
                   approximately 30-36 million years and are restricted to
                   the lineage of vesper bats. We could not detect the
                   presence of Helitrons in any other order of placental
                   mammals, despite the broad representation of these taxa
                   in the databases. We describe an instance of
                   HeliBat-mediated transduction of a host gene fragment
                   that was subsequently dispersed in approximately 1,000
                   copies throughout the M. lucifugus genome. Given the
                   demonstrated propensity of RC transposons to mediate
                   the duplication and shuffling of host genes in bacteria
                   and maize, it is tempting to speculate that the massive
                   amplification of Helitrons in vesper bats has
                   influenced the evolutionary trajectory of these
                   mammals.},

  abstract       = {Contemporary classification of human disease derives
                   from observational correlation between pathological
                   analysis and clinical syndromes. Characterizing disease
                   in this way established a nosology that has served
                   clinicians well to the current time, and depends on
                   observational skills and simple laboratory tools to
                   define the syndromic phenotype. Yet, this time-honored
                   diagnostic strategy has significant shortcomings that
                   reflect both a lack of sensitivity in identifying
                   preclinical disease, and a lack of specificity in
                   defining disease unequivocally. In this paper, we focus
                   on the latter limitation, viewing it as a reflection
                   both of the different clinical presentations of many
                   diseases (variable phenotypic expression), and of the
                   excessive reliance on Cartesian reductionism in
                   establishing diagnoses. The purpose of this perspective
                   is to provide a logical basis for a new approach to
                   classifying human disease that uses conventional
                   reductionism and incorporates the non-reductionist
                   approach of systems biomedicine.},

  abstract       = {Comparative analysis of multiple genomes in a
                   phylogenetic framework dramatically improves the
                   precision and sensitivity of evolutionary inference,
                   producing more robust results than single-genome
                   analyses can provide. The genomes of 12 Drosophila
                   species, ten of which are presented here for the first
                   time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae,
                   persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and
                   grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of
                   sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate
                   evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome
                   sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that
                   have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model
                   for animal genetics, and will further catalyse
                   fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell
                   biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour,
                   physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable
                   similarities among these Drosophila species, we
                   identified many putatively non-neutral changes in
                   protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and
                   cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie
                   differences in the ecology and behaviour of these
                   diverse species.},

                   sequence variation is a statistical enterprise. This is
                   reflected in the increased use of probabilistic models
                   for phylogenetic inference, multiple sequence
                   alignment, and molecular population genetics. Here we
                   present BEAST: a fast, flexible software architecture
                   for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences related by
                   an evolutionary tree. A large number of popular
                   stochastic models of sequence evolution are provided
                   and tree-based models suitable for both within- and
                   between-species sequence data are implemented. RESULTS:
                   BEAST version 1.4.6 consists of 81000 lines of Java
                   source code, 779 classes and 81 packages. It provides
                   models for DNA and protein sequence evolution, highly
                   parametric coalescent analysis, relaxed clock
                   phylogenetics, non-contemporaneous sequence data,
                   statistical alignment and a wide range of options for
                   prior distributions. BEAST source code is
                   object-oriented, modular in design and freely available
                   at http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com/ under the GNU LGPL
                   license. CONCLUSION: BEAST is a powerful and flexible
                   evolutionary analysis package for molecular sequence
                   variation. It also provides a resource for the further
                   development of new models and statistical methods of
                   evolutionary analysis.},

  abstract       = {Mycoplasmas are commonly described as the simplest
                   self-replicating organisms, whose evolution was mainly
                   characterized by genome downsizing with a proposed
                   evolutionary scenario similar to that of obligate
                   intracellular bacteria such as insect endosymbionts.
                   Thus far, analysis of mycoplasma genomes indicates a
                   low level of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) implying
                   that DNA acquisition is strongly limited in these
                   minimal bacteria. In this study, the genome of the
                   ruminant pathogen Mycoplasma agalactiae was sequenced.
                   Comparative genomic data and phylogenetic tree
                   reconstruction revealed that approximately 18\% of its
                   small genome (877,438 bp) has undergone HGT with the
                   phylogenetically distinct mycoides cluster, which is
                   composed of significant ruminant pathogens. HGT
                   involves genes often found as clusters, several of
                   which encode lipoproteins that usually play an
                   important role in mycoplasma-host interaction. A
                   decayed form of a conjugative element also described in
                   a member of the mycoides cluster was found in the M.
                   agalactiae genome, suggesting that HGT may have
                   occurred by mobilizing a related genetic element. The
                   possibility of HGT events among other mycoplasmas was
                   evaluated with the available sequenced genomes. Our
                   data indicate marginal levels of HGT among Mycoplasma
                   species except for those described above and, to a
                   lesser extent, for those observed in between the two
                   bird pathogens, M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae. This
                   first description of large-scale HGT among mycoplasmas
                   sharing the same ecological niche challenges the
                   generally accepted evolutionary scenario in which gene
                   loss is the main driving force of mycoplasma evolution.
                   The latter clearly differs from that of other bacteria
                   with small genomes, particularly obligate intracellular
                   bacteria that are isolated within host cells.
                   Consequently, mycoplasmas are not only able to subvert
                   complex hosts but presumably have retained sexual
                   competence, a trait that may prevent them from genome
                   stasis and contribute to adaptation to new hosts.},

                   through the incremental accumulation of viral
                   mutations, culminating in a novel antigenic type that
                   is able to escape host immunity. Successive epidemic
                   strains therefore become increasingly antigenically
                   distant from a founding strain. Here, we present an
                   alternative explanation where, because of functional
                   constraints on the defining epitopes, the virus
                   population is characterized by a limited set of
                   antigenic types, all of which may be continuously
                   generated by mutation from preexisting strains and
                   other processes. Under these circumstances, influenza
                   outbreaks arise as a consequence of host immune
                   selection in a manner that is independent of the mode
                   and tempo of viral mutation. By contrast with existing
                   paradigms, antigenic distance between epidemic strains
                   does not necessarily accumulate with time in our model,
                   and it is the changing profile of host population
                   immunity that creates the conditions for the emergence
                   of the next influenza strain rather than the mutational
                   capabilities of the virus.},

                   DNA sequences, able to invade the genome of their host
                   thanks to their self-replicating ability. This
                   colonization process has been extensively studied, both
                   theoretically and experimentally, but their long-term
                   coevolution with the genomes is still poorly
                   understood. In this work, we aim to challenge previous
                   population genetics models by considering features of
                   transposable elements as quantitative, rather than
                   discrete, variables. We also describe more realistic
                   transposable element dynamics by accounting for the
                   variability of the insertion effect, from deleterious
                   to adaptive, as well as mutations leading to a loss of
                   transposition activity and to nonautonomous copies.
                   Individual-based simulations of the behavior of a
                   transposable-element family over several thousand
                   generations show different ways in which active or

  abstract       = {We previously identified a group of atypical mobile
                   elements designated Mavericks from the nematodes
                   Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae and the
                   zebrafish Danio rerio. Here we present the results of
                   comprehensive database searches of the genome sequences
                   available, which reveal that Mavericks are widespread
                   in invertebrates and non-mammalian vertebrates but show
                   a patchy distribution in non-animal species, being
                   present in the fungi Glomus intraradices and Phakopsora
                   pachyrhizi and in several single-celled eukaryotes such
                   as the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, the
                   stramenopile Phytophthora infestans and the trichomonad
                   Trichomonas vaginalis, but not detectable in plants.
                   This distribution, together with comparative and
                   phylogenetic analyses of Maverick-encoded proteins, is
                   suggestive of an ancient origin of these elements in
                   eukaryotes followed by lineage-specific losses and/or
                   recurrent episodes of horizontal transmission. In
                   addition, we report that Maverick elements have
                   amplified recently to high copy numbers in T. vaginalis
                   where they now occupy as much as 30\% of the genome.
                   Sequence analysis confirms that most Mavericks encode a
                   retroviral-like integrase, but lack other open reading
                   frames typically found in retroelements. Nevertheless,
                   the length and conservation of the target site
                   duplication created upon Maverick insertion (5- or
                   6-bp) is consistent with a role of the integrase-like
                   protein in the integration of a double-stranded DNA
                   transposition intermediate. Mavericks also display long
                   terminal-inverted repeats but do not contain ORFs
                   similar to proteins encoded by DNA transposons.
                   Instead, Mavericks encode a conserved set of 5 to 9
                   genes (in addition to the integrase) that are predicted
                   to encode proteins with homology to replication and
                   packaging proteins of some bacteriophages and diverse
                   eukaryotic double-stranded DNA viruses, including a DNA
                   polymerase B homolog and putative capsid proteins.
                   Based on these and other structural similarities, we
                   speculate that Mavericks represent an evolutionary
                   missing link between seemingly disparate invasive DNA
                   elements that include bacteriophages, adenoviruses and
                   eukaryotic linear plasmids.},

                   of early evolution where phenotype--organism life
                   expectancy--is directly related to genotype--the
                   stability of its proteins in their native
                   conformations-which can be determined exactly in the
                   model. Simulating the model on a computer, we
                   consistently observe the "Big Bang" scenario whereby
                   exponential population growth ensues as soon as
                   favorable sequence-structure combinations (precursors
                   of stable proteins) are discovered. Upon that, random
                   diversity of the structural space abruptly collapses
                   into a small set of preferred proteins. We observe that
                   protein folds remain stable and abundant in the
                   population at timescales much greater than mutation or
                   organism lifetime, and the distribution of the
                   lifetimes of dominant folds in a population
                   approximately follows a power law. The separation of
                   evolutionary timescales between discovery of new folds
                   and generation of new sequences gives rise to emergence
                   of protein families and superfamilies whose sizes are
                   power-law distributed, closely matching the same
                   distributions for real proteins. On the population
                   level we observe emergence of species--subpopulations
                   that carry similar genomes. Further, we present a
                   simple theory that relates stability of evolving
                   proteins to the sizes of emerging genomes. Together,
                   these results provide a microscopic first-principles
                   picture of how first-gene families developed in the

  abstract       = {Class 2, or DNA transposons, make up approximately 3\%
                   of the human genome, yet the evolutionary history of
                   these elements has been largely overlooked and remains
                   poorly understood. Here we carried out the first
                   comprehensive analysis of the activity of human DNA
                   transposons over the course of primate evolution using
                   three independent computational methods. First, we
                   conducted an exhaustive search for human DNA
                   transposons nested within L1 and Alu elements known to
                   be primate specific. Second, we assessed the
                   presence/absence of 794 human DNA transposons at
                   orthologous positions in 10 mammalian species using
                   sequence data generated by The ENCODE Project. These
                   two approaches, which do not rely upon sequence
                   divergence, allowed us to classify DNA transposons into
                   three different categories: anthropoid specific (40-63
                   My), primate specific (64-80 My), and eutherian wide
                   (81-150 My). Finally, we used this data to calculate
                   the substitution rates of DNA transposons for each
                   category and refine the age of each family based on the
                   average percent divergence of individual copies to
                   their consensus. Based on these combined methods, we
                   can confidently estimate that at least 40 human DNA
                   transposon families, representing approximately 98,000
                   elements ( approximately 33 Mb) in the human genome,
                   have been active in the primate lineage. There was a
                   cessation in the transpositional activity of DNA

                   chromosomal inversions was discovered by Sturtevant and
                   Plunkett in 1926. Our knowledge of how these inversions
                   originate is still very limited, although a prevailing
                   view is that they are facilitated by ectopic
                   recombination events between inverted repetitive
                   sequences. The availability of genome sequences of
                   related species now allows us to study in detail the
                   mechanisms that generate interspecific inversions. We
                   have analyzed the breakpoint regions of the 29
                   inversions that differentiate the chromosomes of
                   Drosophila melanogaster and two closely related
                   species, D. simulans and D. yakuba, and reconstructed
                   the molecular events that underlie their origin.
                   Experimental and computational analysis revealed that
                   the breakpoint regions of 59\% of the inversions
                   (17/29) are associated with inverted duplications of
                   genes or other nonrepetitive sequences. In only two
                   cases do we find evidence for inverted repetitive
                   sequences in inversion breakpoints. We propose that the
                   presence of inverted duplications associated with
                   inversion breakpoint regions is the result of staggered
                   breaks, either isochromatid or chromatid, and that
                   this, rather than ectopic exchange between inverted
                   repetitive sequences, is the prevalent mechanism for
                   the generation of inversions in the melanogaster
                   species group. Outgroup analysis also revealed evidence
                   for widespread breakpoint recycling. Lastly, we have
                   found that expression domains in D. melanogaster may be
                   disrupted in D. yakuba, bringing into question their
                   potential adaptive significance.},

                   our knowledge of the biology of many organisms, in
                   particular insects. However, the accuracy with which
                   laboratory-derived estimates of insect life history and
                   behaviour can predict their fitness and population
                   dynamics in the wild is rarely validated. Such
                   comparison is especially important in cases where
                   laboratory-derived information is used to formulate and
                   implement strategies for the genetic control of insects
                   in nature. We have conducted a comparative study of the
                   reproductive potential and life history of male
                   Anopheles gambiae Gilies sensu lato mosquitoes from
                   both standardized laboratory conditions and from
                   natural field settings. We measured three indirect
                   indicators of male mosquito fitness: energetic
                   reserves, body size and survival, in a bid to determine
                   whether the demographics and energetic limitations of
                   wild males can be correctly predicted from their
                   laboratory counterparts. Crucially, the body size and
                   lipid reserves of wild males were substantially greater
                   than those reared under standard laboratory conditions.
                   We caution that the energetic limitations of insects as
                   identified in the laboratory may underestimate their
                   resilience in the wild, and discuss the implications of
                   this phenomenon with respect to vector-borne disease

                   {N}igeria using the willingness to pay approach.},

  Volume         = {5},

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Malaria illness imposes great burden on
                   the society as it has adverse effects on the physical,
                   mental and social well being of the people as well as
                   on the economic development of the nation. METHODS: The
                   study uses the Willingness To Pay (WTP) approach to
                   evaluate the burden of malaria in Nigeria. RESULTS: The
                   results indicate that households would be prepared to
                   pay an average of about Naira 1,112 (USD 9.3) per month
                   for the treatment of malaria. This is about Naira 427
                   (USD 3.6) in excess of the average expenditure they
                   currently make on malaria treatment per month.
                   Similarly, households are willing to pay on the average
                   a sum of Naira 7,324 (USD 61) per month for the control
                   of malaria. Again, this is an excess of about Naira
                   2,715 (USD 22.6) over the cost they currently bear
                   (protection, treatment and indirect costs), and it
                   represents households' average valuation of their
                   intangible costs of malaria illness. This amount
                   represents about Naira 611.7 (USD 5.1) per head per
                   month and Naira 7,340 (USD 61.2) per year. For a
                   country with a population of about 120 million this
                   translates to about Naira 880,801 million per annum
                   representing about 12.0 per cent of Gross Domestic
                   Product. Hence, the malaria burden in Nigeria is
                   enormous and has a devastating impact on economic
                   growth. CONCLUSION: In the long term, it is important
                   to recognize that health and poverty are closely
                   linked. Reducing the burden of malaria in Nigeria will
                   help to contribute to the economic well-being of
                   communities; and poverty-reduction will be an essential
                   input into improving health. National malaria control
                   programme in Nigeria and their partners need to
                   recognize these links, and identify mechanisms for
                   ensuring that the poorest have access to essential
                   health interventions.},

                   aegypti, the primary vector for yellow fever and dengue
                   fever, which at approximately 1376 million base pairs
                   is about 5 times the size of the genome of the malaria
                   vector Anopheles gambiae. Nearly 50% of the Ae. aegypti
                   genome consists of transposable elements. These
                   contribute to a factor of approximately 4 to 6 increase
                   in average gene length and in sizes of intergenic
                   regions relative to An. gambiae and Drosophila
                   melanogaster. Nonetheless, chromosomal synteny is
                   generally maintained among all three insects, although
                   conservation of orthologous gene order is higher (by a
                   factor of approximately 2) between the mosquito species
                   than between either of them and the fruit fly. An
                   increase in genes encoding odorant binding, cytochrome
                   P450, and cuticle domains relative to An. gambiae
                   suggests that members of these protein families
                   underpin some of the biological differences between the
                   two mosquito species.},

                   sequences able to spread and be maintained in all
                   genomes analyzed so far. Their evolution depends on the
                   interaction they have with the other components of the
                   genome, including genes and other transposable
                   elements. These relationships are complex and have
                   often been compared to those of species living and
                   competing in an ecosystem. The aim of this current work
                   is a proposition to fill the conceptual gap existing
                   between genome biology and ecology, assuming that
                   genomic components, such as transposable elements
                   families, can be compared to species interacting in an
                   ecosystem. Using this framework, some of the main
                   models defined in the population genetics of
                   transposable elements can then been reformulated, and
                   some new kinds of realistic relationships, such as
                   symbiosis between different genomic components, can
                   then be modelled and explored.},

                   the evolutionary and demographic history of organisms.
                   Recently, it has been suggested that genetic
                   information from some parasites can complement genetic
                   data from their hosts. This approach relies upon the
                   hypothesis that such parasites share a common history
                   with their host. In some cases, parasites provide an
                   additional source of information because parasite data
                   can better reconstruct the common history. Here, we
                   discuss which parasite traits are important in
                   determining their usefulness for analysing host
                   history. The key is the matching of the traits of the
                   parasite (e.g. effective population size, generation
                   time, mutation rate and level of host specificity) with
                   the timescales (phylogenetic, phylogeographic and
                   demographic) that are relevant to the issues of concern
                   in host history.},

                   mutations are influenced by the lengths of coding
                   sequences, the number and length of introns, intergenic
                   distances, neighboring genes, mutation rate, and
                   recombination rate. We generate our predictions from
                   estimates of the distribution of the fitness effects of
                   nonsynonymous mutations, obtained from DNA sequence
                   diversity data in Drosophila. Results for genes in
                   regions with typical frequencies of crossing over in
                   Drosophila melanogaster suggest that background
                   selection may influence the effective population sizes
                   of different regions of the same gene, consistent with
                   observed differences in codon usage bias along genes.
                   It may also help to cause the observed effects of gene
                   length and introns on codon usage. Gene conversion
                   plays a crucial role in determining the sizes of these
                   effects. The model overpredicts the effects of
                   background selection with large groups of
                   nonrecombining genes, because it ignores Hill-Robertson
                   interference among the mutations involved.},

                   analyzed within and between populations of three
                   members of the Anopheles gambiae complex. The species
                   selected included the two anthropophilic species, An.
                   gambiae and An. arabiensis and the most zoophilic
                   species of the complex, An. quadriannulatus. The first
                   species was represented by four populations spanning
                   its extreme genetic and geographical ranges, whereas
                   each of the other two species was represented by a
                   single population. We found (i) reduced overall
                   polymorphism in the mature peptide region and in the
                   total coding region, together with specific reductions
                   in rare and moderately frequent mutations (sites) in
                   the coding region compared with non-coding regions,
                   (ii) markedly reduced rate of non-synonymous diversity
                   compared with synonymous variation in the mature
                   peptide and virtually identical mature peptide across
                   the three species, and (iii) increased divergence
                   between species in the mature peptide together with
                   reduced differentiation between populations of An.
                   gambiae in the same DNA region. These patterns suggest
                   a strong purifying selection on the mature peptide and
                   probably the whole coding region. Because An.
                   quadriannulatus is not exposed to human pathogens,
                   identical mature peptide and similar pattern of
                   polymorphism across species implies that human
                   pathogens played no role as selective agents on this

                   replacement strategies to control vector-borne diseases
                   such as malaria and dengue. "Population replacement" is
                   the replacement of wild vector populations (that are
                   competent to transmit pathogens) with those that are
                   not competent to transmit pathogens. There are several
                   theoretical strategies to accomplish this. One is to
                   exploit the maternally-inherited symbiotic bacteria
                   Wolbachia pipientis. Wolbachia is a widespread
                   reproductive parasite that spreads in a selfish manner
                   at the extent of its host's fitness. Jason Rasgon
                   discusses, in detail, the basic biology of this
                   bacterial symbiont and various ways to use it for

  abstract       = {The P instability factor or PIF superfamily of DNA
                   transposons constitutes an important group of
                   transposable elements (TEs) in plants, but it is still
                   poorly characterized in metazoans. Taking advantage of
                   the availability of draft genome sequences for twelve
                   Drosophila species, we discovered 4 different lineages
                   of Drosophila PIF-like transposons, named DPLT1-4.
                   These lineages have experienced a complex evolutionary
                   history during the Drosophila radiation, involving
                   differential amplification and retention among species
                   and probable events of horizontal transmission. Like
                   previously described plant and animal PIF transposons,
                   full-length DPLTs encode a putative transposase as well
                   as a second predicted protein containing a Myb/SANT
                   domain. In DPLTs, this domain is most closely related
                   to the MADF DNA-binding domain found in several
                   Drosophila transcription factors. In addition, we
                   identified 7 distinct genes distributed across the
                   Drosophila genus that encode proteins related to PIF
                   transposases, but lack the hallmarks of transposons.
                   Instead, these sequences show features of functional
                   genes, such as an intact coding region evolving under
                   purifying selection, the presence of orthologs in at
                   least 2 Drosophila species, and the conservation of
                   intron/exon structure across orthologs. We also provide
                   evidence that most of these genes are transcribed and
                   that some are developmentally regulated. Together the
                   data indicate that these genes derived from
                   PIF-transposons that have been "domesticated" to serve
                   cellular functions. In one instance the recruitment of
                   the transposase gene was accompanied by the
                   co-recruitment of the adjacent second PIF gene, which
                   raises the hypothesis that both proteins now function
                   in the same pathway. The second PIF gene has retained
                   the capacity to encode a protein with an intact MADF
                   domain, suggesting that it may function as a
                   transcription factor. We conclude that PIF transposons
                   are common in the Drosophila lineage and have been a
                   recurrent source of new genes during Drosophila
                   evolution.},

                   The photoreceptor phytochrome A (phyA) mediates various
                   far-red light-induced responses. We show that
                   Arabidopsis FHY3 and FAR1, which encode two proteins
                   related to Mutator-like transposases, act together to
                   modulate phyA signaling by directly activating the
                   transcription of FHY1 and FHL, whose products are
                   essential for light-induced phyA nuclear accumulation
                   and subsequent light responses. FHY3 and FAR1 have
                   separable DNA binding and transcriptional activation
                   domains that are highly conserved in Mutator-like
                   transposases. Further, expression of FHY3 and FAR1 is
                   negatively regulated by phyA signaling. We propose that
                   FHY3 and FAR1 represent transcription factors that have
                   been co-opted from an ancient Mutator-like
                   transposase(s) to modulate phyA-signaling homeostasis

                   in a rural Tanzanian setting and identify any
                   differences by socioeconomic status and season.
                   METHODS: Interviews of 557 households in south eastern
                   Tanzania between May and December 2004, on consumption
                   and malaria-related costs. RESULTS: Malaria-related
                   expenses were significantly higher in the dry,
                   non-malarious season than in the rainy season.
                   Households sought treatment more frequently and from
                   more expensive service providers in the dry season,
                   when they have more money. Malaria expenses did not
                   vary significantly across socioeconomic status
                   quintiles, but poorer households spent a higher
                   proportion of their consumption in both seasons.
                   CONCLUSION: Poorer households bear a greater economic
                   burden from malaria relative to their consumption than
                   better-off households. Households are particularly
                   vulnerable to malaria in the rainy season, when malaria
                   prevalence is highest but liquidity is lower.
                   Alternative strategies to assist households to cope
                   with seasonal liquidity issues, including insurance,
                   should be investigated.},

                   the evolutionary and demographic history of organisms.
                   Recently, it has been suggested that genetic
                   information from some parasites can complement genetic
                   data from their hosts. This approach relies upon the
                   hypothesis that such parasites share a common history
                   with their host. In some cases, parasites provide an
                   additional source of information because parasite data
                   can better reconstruct the common history. Here, we
                   discuss which parasite traits are important in
                   determining their usefulness for analysing host
                   history. The key is the matching of the traits of the
                   parasite (e.g. effective population size, generation
                   time, mutation rate and level of host specificity) with
                   the timescales (phylogenetic, phylogeographic and
                   demographic) that are relevant to the issues of concern
                   in host history.},

                   dissociation of drive and disease refractoriness

                   silencing of a maternally expressed gene essential for
                   embryogenesis, which is coupled with early zygotic

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates have been
                   classified in eight genotypes, A to H, which exhibit
                   distinct geographical distributions. Genotypes A, D and
                   F are predominant in Brazil, a country formed by a
                   miscegenated population, where the proportion of
                   individuals from Caucasian, Amerindian and African
                   origins varies by region. Genotype F, which is the most
                   divergent, is considered indigenous to the Americas. A
                   systematic molecular characterization of HBV isolates
                   from different parts of the world would be invaluable
                   in establishing HBV evolutionary origins and dispersion
                   patterns. A large-scale study is needed to map the
                   region-by-region distribution of the HBV genotypes in
                   Brazil. RESULTS: Genotyping by PCR-RFLP of 303 HBV
                   isolates from HBsAg-positive blood donors showed that
                   at least two of the three genotypes, A, D, and F,
                   co-circulate in each of the five geographic regions of
                   Brazil. No other genotypes were identified. Overall,
                   genotype A was most prevalent (48.5\%), and most of
                   these isolates were classified as subgenotype A1
                   (138/153; 90.2\%). Genotype D was the most common
                   genotype in the South (84.2\%) and Central (47.6\%)
                   regions. The prevalence of genotype F was low (13\%)
                   countrywide. Nucleotide sequencing of the S gene and a
                   phylogenetic analysis of 32 HBV genotype F isolates
                   showed that a great majority (28/32; 87.5\%) belonged
                   to subgenotype F2, cluster II. The deduced serotype of
                   31 of 32 F isolates was adw4. The remaining isolate
                   showed a leucine-to-isoleucine substitution at position
                   127. CONCLUSION: The presence of genotypes A, D and F,
                   and the absence of other genotypes in a large cohort of
                   HBV infected individuals may reflect the ethnic origins
                   of the Brazilian population. The high prevalence of
                   isolates from subgenotype A1 (of African origin)
                   indicates that the African influx during the colonial
                   slavery period had a major impact on the circulation of
                   HBV genotype A currently found in Brazil. Although most
                   genotype F isolates belonged to cluster II, the
                   presence of some isolates belonging to clusters I
                   (subgroup Ib) and IV suggests the existence of two or
                   more founder viral populations of genotype F in Brazil.},

                   The scope is restricted to infectious diseases and the
                   evolution of virulence as a consequence of public
                   health strategies to control transmission. We focus on
                   the discussion about the possibility of virulence
                   management and explore current scenarios in which
                   recent advances in molecular biology and genetics offer
                   new tools to monitor and change diversity among
                   pathogens, vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. We stress
                   the need to integrate the analytical framework of
                   epidemiology into population genetics and evolutionary
                   theory. We anticipate as an outcome of this process the
                   development of study designs and analytical tools to
                   predict the evolutionary implications of control
                   measures in the population and surveillance mechanisms
                   to continuously monitor the changes in pathogen
                   virulence patterns. Communication among modelers,
                   epidemiologists and molecular biologists is essential
                   in order to design model-driven field trials and to
                   develop data-driven analytical tools leading to
                   conclusive findings that can inform the public health

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: There are several situations in population
                   biology research where simulating DNA sequences is
                   useful. Simulation of biological populations under
                   different evolutionary genetic models can be undertaken
                   using backward or forward strategies. Backward
                   simulations, also called coalescent-based simulations,
                   are computationally efficient. The reason is that they
                   are based on the history of lineages with surviving
                   offspring in the current population. On the contrary,
                   forward simulations are less efficient because the
                   entire population is simulated from past to present.
                   However, the coalescent framework imposes some
                   limitations that forward simulation does not. Hence,
                   there is an increasing interest in forward population
                   genetic simulation and efficient new tools have been
                   developed recently. Software tools that allow efficient
                   simulation of large DNA fragments under complex
                   evolutionary models will be very helpful when trying to
                   better understand the trace left on the DNA by the
                   different interacting evolutionary forces. Here I will
                   introduce GenomePop, a forward simulation program that
                   fulfills the above requirements. The use of the program
                   is demonstrated by studying the impact of intracodon
                   recombination on global and site-specific dN/dS
                   estimation. RESULTS: I have developed algorithms and
                   written software to efficiently simulate, forward in
                   time, different Markovian nucleotide or codon models of
                   DNA mutation. Such models can be combined with
                   recombination, at inter and intra codon levels,
                   fitness-based selection and complex demographic
                   scenarios. CONCLUSION: GenomePop has many interesting
                   characteristics for simulating SNPs or DNA sequences
                   under complex evolutionary and demographic models.
                   These features make it unique with respect to other
                   simulation tools. Namely, the possibility of forward
                   simulation under General Time Reversible (GTR) mutation
                   or GTRxMG94 codon models with intra-codon
                   recombination, arbitrary, user-defined, migration
                   patterns, diploid or haploid models, constant or
                   variable population sizes, etc. It also allows
                   simulation of fitness-based selection under different
                   distributions of mutational effects. Under the 2-allele
                   model it allows the simulation of recombination
                   hot-spots, the definition of different frequencies in
                   different populations, etc. GenomePop can also manage
                   large DNA fragments. In addition, it has a scaling
                   option to save computation time when simulating large
                   sequences and population sizes under complex
                   demographic and evolutionary situations. These and many
                   other features are detailed in its web page [1].},

                   recognized but its paths are multiple and complex.
                   Recent studies suggest that causality works both ways,
                   trapping communities in reinforcing cycles of poverty
                   and disease. If malaria is to be controlled or
                   eventually eliminated, the social and economic
                   conditions that fuel malaria transmission need to be
                   addressed. At the same time, malaria control should be

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Because of the advent of high-throughput
                   sequencing and the consequent reduction in the cost of
                   sequencing, many organisms have been completely
                   sequenced and most of their genes identified. It thus
                   has become possible to represent whole genomes as
                   ordered lists of gene identifiers and to study the
                   rearrangement of these entities through computational
                   means. As a result, genome rearrangement data has
                   attracted increasing attentions from both biologists
                   and computer scientists as a new type of data for
                   phylogenetic analysis. The main events of genome
                   rearrangements include inversions, transpositions and
                   transversions. To date, GRAPPA and MGR are the most
                   accurate methods for rearrangement phylogeny, both
                   assuming inversion as the only event. However, due to
                   the complexity of computing transposition distance, it
                   is very difficult to analyze datasets when
                   transpositions are dominant. RESULTS: We extend GRAPPA
                   to handle transpositions. The new method is named
                   GRAPPA-TP, with two major extensions: a heuristic
                   method to estimate transposition distance, and a new
                   transposition median solver for three genomes. Although
                   GRAPPA-TP uses a greedy approach to compute the
                   transposition distance, it is very accurate when
                   genomes are relatively close. The new GRAPPA-TP is
                   available from http://phylo.cse.sc.edu/. CONCLUSION:
                   Our extensive testing using simulated datasets shows
                   that GRAPPA-TP is very accurate in terms of ancestor
                   genome inference and phylogenetic reconstruction.
                   Simulation results also suggest that model match is
                   critical in genome rearrangement analysis: it is not
                   accurate to simulate transpositions with other events
                   including inversions.},

  abstract       = {DNA transposons, or class 2 transposable elements,
                   have successfully propagated in a wide variety of
                   genomes. However, it is widely believed that DNA
                   transposon activity has ceased in mammalian genomes for
                   at least the last 40 million years. We recently
                   reported evidence for the relatively recent activity of
                   hAT and Helitron elements, two distinct groups of DNA
                   transposons, in the lineage of the vespertilionid bat
                   Myotis lucifugus. Here, we describe seven additional
                   families that have also been recently active in the bat
                   lineage. Early vespertilionid genome evolution was
                   dominated by the activity of Helitrons, mariner-like
                   and Tc2-like elements. This was followed by the
                   colonization of Tc1-like elements, and by a more recent
                   explosion of hAT-like elements. Finally, and most
                   recently, piggyBac-like elements have amplified within
                   the Myotis genome and our results indicate that one of
                   these families is probably still expanding in natural
                   populations. Together, these data suggest that there
                   has been tremendous recent activity of various DNA
                   transposons in the bat lineage that far exceeds those
                   previously reported for any mammalian lineage. The
                   diverse and recent populations of DNA transposons in
                   genus Myotis will provide an unprecedented opportunity
                   to study the impact of this class of elements on
                   mammalian genome evolution and to better understand
                   what makes some species more susceptible to invasion by
                   genomic parasites than others.},

  abstract       = {The mammalian centromere-associated protein B (CENP-B)
                   shares significant sequence similarity with 3 proteins
                   in fission yeast (Abp1, Cbh1, and Cbh2) that also bind
                   centromeres and have essential function for chromosome
                   segregation and centromeric heterochromatin formation.
                   Each of these proteins displays extensive sequence
                   similarity with pogo-like transposases, which have been
                   previously identified in the genomes of various insects
                   and vertebrates, in the protozoan Entamoeba and in
                   plants. Based on this distribution, it has been
                   proposed that the mammalian and fission yeast
                   centromeric proteins are derived from "domesticated"
                   pogo-like transposons. Here we took advantage of the
                   vast amount of sequence information that has become
                   recently available for a wide range of fungal and
                   animal species to investigate the origin of the
                   mammalian CENP-B and yeast CENP-B-like genes. A highly
                   conserved ortholog of CENP-B was detected in 31 species
                   of mammals, including opossum and platypus, but was
                   absent from all nonmammalian species represented in the
                   databases. Similarly, no ortholog of the fission yeast
                   centromeric proteins was identified in any of the
                   various fungal genomes currently available. In
                   contrast, we discovered a plethora of novel pogo-like
                   transposons in diverse invertebrates and vertebrates
                   and in several filamentous fungi. Phylogenetic analysis
                   revealed that the mammalian and fission yeast CENP-B
                   proteins fall into 2 distinct monophyletic clades, each
                   of which includes a different set of pogo-like
                   transposons. These results are most parsimoniously
                   explained by independent domestication events of
                   pogo-like transposases into centromeric proteins in the
                   mammalian and fission yeast lineages, a case of
                   "convergent domestication." These findings highlight
                   the propensity of transposases to give rise to new host
                   proteins and the potential of transposons as sources of
                   genetic innovation.},

  abstract       = {Horizontal transfer (HT) is central to the evolution
                   of prokaryotic species. Selfish and mobile genetic
                   elements, such as phages, plasmids, and transposons,
                   are the primary vehicles for HT among prokaryotes. In
                   multicellular eukaryotes, the prevalence and
                   evolutionary significance of HT remain unclear. Here,
                   we identified a set of DNA transposon families dubbed
                   SPACE INVADERS (or SPIN) whose consensus sequences are
                   approximately 96\% identical over their entire length
                   (2.9 kb) in the genomes of murine rodents (rat/mouse),
                   bushbaby (prosimian primate), little brown bat
                   (laurasiatherian), tenrec (afrotherian), opossum
                   (marsupial), and two non-mammalian tetrapods (anole
                   lizard and African clawed frog). In contrast, SPIN
                   elements were undetectable in other species represented
                   in the sequence databases, including 19 other mammals
                   with draft whole-genome assemblies. This patchy
                   distribution, coupled with the extreme level of SPIN
                   identity in widely divergent tetrapods and the overall
                   lack of selective constraint acting on these elements,
                   is incompatible with vertical inheritance, but strongly
                   indicative of multiple horizontal introductions. We
                   show that these germline infiltrations likely occurred
                   around the same evolutionary time (15-46 mya) and
                   spawned some of the largest bursts of DNA transposon
                   activity ever recorded in any species lineage (nearly
                   100,000 SPIN copies per haploid genome in tenrec). The
                   process also led to the emergence of a new gene in the
                   murine lineage derived from a SPIN transposase. In
                   summary, HT of DNA transposons has contributed
                   significantly to shaping and diversifying the genomes
                   of multiple mammalian and tetrapod species.},

                   holds great promise for establishing strains that
                   improve population control and behavior for practical
                   application. This is especially so for insects that are
                   disease vectors, many of which are currently subject to
                   genomic sequence analysis, and intensive population
                   control measures that must be improved for better
                   efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Transposon-mediated
                   germ-line transformation has been the ultimate goal for
                   most fundamental and practical studies, and impressive
                   strides have been made in recent development of
                   transgene vector and marker systems for several
                   mosquito species. This has resulted in rapid advances
                   in functional genomic sequence analysis and new
                   strategies for biological control based on conditional
                   lethality. Importantly, advances have also been made in
                   our ability to use these systems more effectively in
                   terms of enhanced stability and targeting to specific
                   genomic loci. Nevertheless, not all insects are
                   currently amenable to germ-line transformation
                   techniques, and thus advances in transient somatic
                   expression and paratransgenesis have also been
                   critical, if not preferable for some applications. Of
                   particular importance is how this technology will be
                   used for practical application. Early ideas for
                   population replacement of indigenous pests with
                   innocuous transgenic siblings by transposon-vector
                   spread, may require reevaluation in terms of our
                   current knowledge of the behavior of transposons
                   currently available for transformation. The effective
                   implementation of any control program using released
                   transgenics, will also benefit from broadening the
                   perspective of these control measures as being more
                   mainstream than exotic.},

  abstract       = {Tree thinking is an integral part of modern
                   evolutionary biology, and a necessary precondition for
                   phylogenetics and comparative analyses. Tree thinking
                   has during the 20th century largely replaced group
                   thinking, developmental thinking and anthropocentrism
                   in biology. Unfortunately, however, this does not imply
                   that tree thinking can be taken for granted. The
                   findings reported here indicate that tree thinking is
                   very much an acquired ability which needs extensive
                   training. I tested a sample of undergraduate and
                   graduate students of biology by means of
                   questionnaires. Not a single student was able to
                   correctly interpret a simple tree drawing. Several
                   other findings demonstrate that tree thinking is
                   virtually absent in students unless they are explicitly
                   taught how to read evolutionary trees. Possible causes
                   and implications of this mental bias are discussed. It
                   seems that biological textbooks can be an important
                   source of confusion for students. While group and
                   developmental thinking have disappeared from most
                   textual representations of evolution, they have
                   survived in the evolutionary tree drawings of many
                   textbooks. It is quite common for students to encounter
                   anthropocentric trees and even trees containing stem
                   groups and paraphyla. While these biases originate from
                   the unconscious philosophical assumptions made by
                   authors, the findings suggest that presenting unbiased
                   evolutionary trees in biological publications is not
                   merely a philosophical virtue but has also clear
                   practical implications.},

                   despite the biological relevance of analyses of

                   under adaptive evolution in HIV clades, while in SIVcpz

                   Plasmodium development and is a potential target of
                   innovative malaria control strategies. The extent and
                   distribution of nucleotide diversity in immunity genes
                   might provide insights into the evolutionary forces
                   that condition pathogen-vector interactions. The
                   discovery of polymorphisms is an essential step towards
                   association studies of susceptibility to infection.
                   RESULTS: We sequenced coding fragments of 72 immune
                   related genes in natural populations of Anopheles
                   gambiae and of 37 randomly chosen genes to provide a
                   background measure of genetic diversity across the
                   genome. Mean nucleotide diversity (pi) was 0.0092 in
                   the A. gambiae S form, 0.0076 in the M form and 0.0064
                   in A. arabiensis. Within each species, no statistically
                   significant differences in mean nucleotide diversity
                   were detected between immune related and non immune
                   related genes. Strong purifying selection was detected
                   in genes of both categories, presumably reflecting
                   strong functional constraints. CONCLUSION: Our results
                   suggest similar patterns and rates of molecular
                   evolution in immune and non-immune genes in A. gambiae.

                   molecular biology, our understanding of cell function
                   and genome action has benefited from many radical
                   discoveries. The discoveries relate to interactive
                   multimolecular execution of cell processes, the modular
                   organization of macromolecules and genomes, the
                   hierarchical operation of cellular control regimes, and
                   the realization that genetic change fundamentally
                   results from DNA biochemistry. These discoveries
                   contradict atomistic pre-DNA ideas of genome
                   organization and violate the central dogma at multiple
                   points. In place of the earlier mechanistic
                   understanding of genomics, molecular biology has led us
                   to an informatic perspective on the role of the genome.
                   The informatic viewpoint points towards the development
                   of novel concepts about cellular cognition, molecular
                   representations of physiological states, genome system
                   architecture, and the algorithmic nature of genome

                   simulation methods are employed to predict the
                   signature of selection in sequence variation. The most
                   informative and efficient method currently in use is
                   coalescent simulation. However, this method is limited
                   to simple models of directional selection.
                   Whole-population forward-in-time simulations are the
                   alternative to coalescent simulations for more complex

                   computational cost in forward-in-time simulations can
                   be overcome by various simplifying amendments. Overall,
                   the success of simulations depends on the creative

                   lack of available empirical data to validate these
                   models and inherent assumptions. Genomes can provide a
                   snapshot of several TE families in a single organism,
                   and these could have their demographics inferred by
                   coalescent analysis, allowing for the testing of
                   theories on TE amplification dynamics. Using the
                   available genomes of the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and
                   Anopheles gambiae, we indicate that such an approach is

                   the two mosquito genomes currently available in search
                   of TE families; (2) fitting, to selected families found

                   unprecedented opportunities for testing central tenets
                   of evolutionary biology formulated by Darwin in the
                   Origin of Species in 1859 and expanded in the Modern
                   Synthesis 100 years later. Evolutionary-genomic studies
                   show that natural selection is only one of the forces
                   that shape genome evolution and is not quantitatively
                   dominant, whereas non-adaptive processes are much more
                   prominent than previously suspected. Major
                   contributions of horizontal gene transfer and diverse
                   selfish genetic elements to genome evolution undermine
                   the Tree of Life concept. An adequate depiction of
                   evolution requires the more complex concept of a
                   network or 'forest' of life. There is no consistent
                   tendency of evolution towards increased genomic
                   complexity, and when complexity increases, this appears
                   to be a non-adaptive consequence of evolution under
                   weak purifying selection rather than an adaptation.
                   Several universals of genome evolution were discovered
                   including the invariant distributions of evolutionary
                   rates among orthologous genes from diverse genomes and
                   of paralogous gene family sizes, and the negative
                   correlation between gene expression level and sequence
                   evolution rate. Simple, non-adaptive models of
                   evolution explain some of these universals, suggesting
                   that a new synthesis of evolutionary biology might
                   become feasible in a not so remote future.},

                   polymorphisms, or SNPs, contains a tremendous amount of
                   information with respect to the mechanisms of the
                   micro-evolutionary process of a species. The inference
                   of the roles of these mechanisms, including natural
                   selection, relies heavily on computer simulations. A
                   coalescent simulation is extremely powerful in
                   generating a large number of samples of DNA sequences
                   from a population (species) when all mutations are
                   neutral, and Hudson's ms software is frequently used
                   for this purpose.However, it has been difficult to
                   incorporate natural selection into the coalescent
                   framework. RESULTS: We herein present a software
                   application to generate samples of DNA sequences when
                   there is a biallelic site targeted by selection. This
                   software application, referred to as mbs, is developed
                   by modifying Hudson's ms. The mbs software is so
                   flexible that it can incorporate any arbitrary
                   histories of population size changes and any mode of
                   selection as long as selection is operating on a
                   biallelic site. CONCLUSION: mbs provides opportunities
                   to investigate the effect of any mode of selection on
                   the pattern of SNPs under various demography.},

  abstract       = {As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the
                   geographical distribution of viruses has been
                   frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic
                   histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical
                   dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly
                   been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that
                   provide little insight into the temporal setting of the
                   spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic
                   models of evolution, however, offers unique
                   opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor.
                   Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference,
                   visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic
                   history. By implementing character mapping in a
                   Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies,
                   we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal
                   patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty.
                   Standard Markov model inference is extended with a
                   stochastic search variable selection procedure that
                   identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the
                   diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that
                   can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or
                   characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial
                   dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal
                   information, we summarize inferences using virtual
                   globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography
                   compares with previous parsimony analysis in the
                   investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1
                   epidemiological linkage among sampling localities.
                   Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations
                   reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic
                   maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From
                   these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic
                   framework will make an important asset in molecular
                   epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer
                   biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.},

                   population size from genetic sequences and mathematical
                   models of infectious disease in populations. Virus
                   phylogenies have been used in many recent studies to
                   infer properties of epidemics. These approaches rely on
                   coalescent models that may not be appropriate for
                   infectious diseases. We account for phylogenetic
                   patterns of viruses in susceptible-infected (SI),
                   susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS), and
                   susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models of
                   infectious disease, and our approach may be a viable
                   alternative to demographic models used to reconstruct
                   epidemic dynamics. The method allows epidemiological
                   parameters, such as the reproductive number, to be
                   estimated directly from viral sequence data. We also
                   describe patterns of phylogenetic clustering that are
                   often construed as arising from a short chain of
                   transmissions. Our model reproduces the moments of the
                   distribution of phylogenetic cluster sizes and may
                   therefore serve as a null hypothesis for cluster sizes
                   under simple epidemiological models. We examine a small
                   cross-sectional sample of human immunodeficiency
                   (HIV)-1 sequences collected in the United States and
                   compare our results to standard estimates of effective
                   population size. Estimated prevalence is consistent
                   with estimates of effective population size and the
                   known history of the HIV epidemic. While our model
                   accurately estimates prevalence during exponential
                   growth, we find that periods of decline are harder to
                   identify.},

                   populations with genetically modified versions is being
                   explored as a potential strategy to control
                   vector-borne diseases. Due to lower expected relative
                   fitness of transgenic individuals, transgenes must be
                   driven into populations for these scenarios to be
                   successful. Several gene drive mechanisms exist in a
                   theoretical sense but none are currently workable in
                   mosquitoes. Even if strategies were workable, it would
                   be very difficult to recall released transgenes in the
                   event of unforeseen consequences. What is needed is a
                   way to test transgenes in the field for feasibility,
                   efficacy and safety prior to releasing an active drive
                   mechanism. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We outline a
                   method, termed Multi-locus assortment (MLA), to spread
                   transgenes into vector populations by the release of
                   genetically-modified mosquitoes carrying multiple
                   stable transgene inserts. Simulations indicate that [1]
                   insects do not have to carry transgenes at more than 4
                   loci, [2] transgenes can be maintained at high levels
                   by sequential small releases, the frequency of which
                   depends on the construct fitness cost, and [3] in the
                   case of unforeseen negative non-target effects,
                   transgenes can be eliminated from the population by
                   halting transgenic releases and/or mass releases of
                   wild-type insects. We also discuss potential methods to
                   create MLA mosquito strains in the laboratory.
                   CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While not as efficient as
                   active drive mechanisms, MLA has other advantages: [1]
                   MLA strains can be constructed for some mosquito
                   species with currently-available technology, [2] MLA
                   will allow the ecological components of transgenic
                   mosquito releases to be tested before actual gene drive
                   mechanisms are ready to be deployed, [3] since MLA is
                   not self-propagating, the risk of an accidental
                   premature release into nature is minimized, and [4] in
                   the case that active gene drive mechanisms prove
                   impossible to develop, the MLA approach can be used as
                   a back-up transgene dispersal mechanism for disease
                   control efforts in some systems.},

  abstract       = {Dengue is a major public health concern in the tropics
                   and subtropics. Innovative transgenic strategies to
                   render Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector of
                   dengue, incompetent for dengue transmission are under
                   development. We modeled the evolutionary impact of
                   different transgenic mosquito strategies on
                   dengue-induced mortality, that is, dengue virulence, to
                   both humans and mosquitoes. This model incorporates
                   various evolutionary trade-offs in dengue virus
                   epidemiological traits, for example, a trade-off
                   between dengue transmission rate and its virulence to
                   humans. Our results indicate that strategies that block
                   transmission or reduce mosquito biting impose selection
                   on dengue virulence in humans. This selection can be
                   for either higher or lower virulence, depending on the
                   interaction between the effect of the transgene and the
                   trade-offs in epidemiological traits, highlighting the
                   need for detailed quantitative data to understand more
                   fully the impact of mosquito transgenesis on dengue
                   virulence. Dengue virulence in mosquitoes can be
                   selected on by transgenic strategies of blocking
                   transmission, decreased mosquito biting, increased
                   mosquito background mortality, and increased mosquito
                   infection-induced mortality. Our results suggest that
                   dengue control strategies that raise mosquito
                   background mortality or mosquito infection-induced
                   mortality pose less risk of causing increased virulence
                   to humans than strategies that block transmission or
                   reduce mosquito biting.},

  Title          = {Bayesian random local clocks, or one rate to rule them
                   all.},
  Journal        = {BMC Biol},
  Volume         = {8},
  Pages          = {114},
  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Relaxed molecular clock models allow
                   divergence time dating and "relaxed phylogenetic"
                   inference, in which a time tree is estimated in the
                   face of unequal rates across lineages. We present a new
                   method for relaxing the assumption of a strict
                   molecular clock using Markov chain Monte Carlo to
                   implement Bayesian modeling averaging over random local
                   molecular clocks. The new method approaches the problem
                   of rate variation among lineages by proposing a series
                   of local molecular clocks, each extending over a
                   subregion of the full phylogeny. Each branch in a
                   phylogeny (subtending a clade) is a possible location
                   for a change of rate from one local clock to a new one.
                   Thus, including both the global molecular clock and the
                   unconstrained model results, there are a total of
                   2(2n-2) possible rate models available for averaging
                   with 1, 2, ..., 2n - 2 different rate categories.
                   RESULTS: We propose an efficient method to sample this
                   model space while simultaneously estimating the
                   phylogeny. The new method conveniently allows a direct
                   test of the strict molecular clock, in which one rate
                   rules them all, against a large array of alternative
                   local molecular clock models. We illustrate the
                   method's utility on three example data sets involving
                   mammal, primate and influenza evolution. Finally, we
                   explore methods to visualize the complex posterior
                   distribution that results from inference under such
                   models. CONCLUSIONS: The examples suggest that large
                   sequence datasets may only require a small number of
                   local molecular clocks to reconcile their branch
                   lengths with a time scale. All of the analyses
                   described here are implemented in the open access

                   the genome as an interactive read-write (RW) memory
                   system rather than an organism blueprint. Genome
                   sequencing has documented the importance of mobile DNA
                   activities and major genome restructuring events at key
                   junctures in evolution: exon shuffling, changes in
                   cis-regulatory sites, horizontal transfer, cell fusions
                   and whole genome doublings (WGDs). The natural genetic
                   engineering functions that mediate genome restructuring
                   are activated by multiple stimuli, in particular by
                   events similar to those found in the DNA record:
                   microbial infection and interspecific hybridization
                   leading to the formation of allotetraploids. These
                   molecular genetic discoveries, plus a consideration of
                   how mobile DNA rearrangements increase the efficiency
                   of generating functional genomic novelties, make it
                   possible to formulate a 21st century view of
                   interactive evolutionary processes. This view
                   integrates contemporary knowledge of the molecular
                   basis of genetic change, major genome events in
                   evolution, and stimuli that activate DNA restructuring
                   with classical cytogenetic understanding about the role
                   of hybridization in species diversification.},

  abstract       = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a recently
                   developed technique for solving problems in Bayesian
                   inference. Although typically less accurate than, for
                   example, the frequently used Markov Chain Monte Carlo
                   (MCMC) methods, they have greater flexibility because
                   they do not require the specification of a likelihood
                   function. For this reason considerable amounts of data
                   can be analysed and more complex models can be used
                   providing, thereby, a potential better fit of the model
                   to the data. Since its first applications in the late
                   1990s its usage has been steadily increasing. The
                   framework was originally developed to solve problems in
                   population genetics. However, as its efficiency was
                   recognized its popularity increased and, consequently,
                   it started to be used in fields as diverse as
                   phylogenetics, ecology, conservation, molecular
                   evolution and epidemiology. While the ABC algorithm is
                   still being greatly studied and alterations to it are
                   being proposed, the statistical approach has already
                   reached a level of maturity well demonstrated by the
                   number of related computer packages that are being
                   developed. As improved ABC algorithms are proposed, the
                   expansion of the use of this method can only increase.
                   In this paper we are going to depict the context that
                   led to the development of ABC focusing on the field of
                   infectious disease epidemiology. We are then going to
                   describe its current usage in such field and present
                   its most recent developments.},

                   statistical analysis. Systems with near-chaotic
                   dynamics are little better. Such systems are almost
                   invariably driven by endogenous dynamic processes plus
                   demographic and environmental process noise, and are
                   only observable with error. Their sensitivity to
                   history means that minute changes in the driving noise
                   realization, or the system parameters, will cause
                   drastic changes in the system trajectory. This
                   sensitivity is inherited and amplified by the joint
                   probability density of the observable data and the
                   process noise, rendering it useless as the basis for
                   obtaining measures of statistical fit. Because the
                   joint density is the basis for the fit measures used by
                   all conventional statistical methods, this is a major
                   theoretical shortcoming. The inability to make
                   well-founded statistical inferences about biological
                   dynamic models in the chaotic and near-chaotic regimes,
                   other than on an ad hoc basis, leaves dynamic theory
                   without the methods of quantitative validation that are
                   essential tools in the rest of biological science. Here
                   I show that this impasse can be resolved in a simple
                   and general manner, using a method that requires only
                   the ability to simulate the observed data on a system
                   from the dynamic model about which inferences are
                   required. The raw data series are reduced to
                   phase-insensitive summary statistics, quantifying local
                   dynamic structure and the distribution of observations.
                   Simulation is used to obtain the mean and the
                   covariance matrix of the statistics, given model
                   parameters, allowing the construction of a 'synthetic
                   likelihood' that assesses model fit. This likelihood
                   can be explored using a straightforward Markov chain
                   Monte Carlo sampler, but one further post-processing
                   step returns pure likelihood-based inference. I apply
                   the method to establish the dynamic nature of the
                   fluctuations in Nicholson's classic blowfly
                   experiments.},

                   three distinct frameworks for phylogeographic inference
                   to give a taste of this disagreement. Each of the three
                   approaches presents a different viewpoint on
                   phylogeography, most fundamentally on how we view the

                   trivial models of phylogeographic processes.

                   analysis of phylogenies, through the application of
                   time-varying coalescent models. This approach has been
                   used to study the dynamics of many different viruses,
                   and has demonstrated a wide variety of patterns, which
                   have been interpreted in the context of changes over
                   time in the 'effective number of infections', a
                   quantity proportional to the number of infected
                   individuals. However, for infectious diseases, the rate
                   of coalescence is driven primarily by new transmissions
                   i.e. the incidence, and only indirectly by the number
                   of infected individuals through sampling effects. Using
                   commonly used epidemiological models, we show that the

                   infected individuals during the initial phase of
                   exponential growth when time is scaled by infectivity,
                   but in general, a single change in time scale cannot be
                   used to estimate the number of infected individuals.
                   This has important implications when integrating

  abstract       = {Dengue is an emerging tropical disease infecting tens
                   of millions of people annually. A febrile illness with
                   potentially severe hemorrhagic manifestations, dengue
                   is caused by mosquito-borne viruses (DENV-1 to -4) that
                   are maintained in endemic transmission in large urban
                   centers of the tropics with periodic epidemic cycles at
                   3- to 5-year intervals. Puerto Rico (PR), a major
                   population center in the Caribbean, has experienced
                   increasingly severe epidemics since multiple dengue
                   serotypes were introduced beginning in the late 1970s.
                   We document the phylodynamics of DENV-4 between 1981
                   and 1998, a period of dramatic ecological expansion
                   during which evolutionary change also occurs. The
                   timescale of viral evolution is sufficiently short that
                   viral transmission dynamics can be elucidated from
                   genetic diversity data. Specifically, by combining
                   virus sequence data with confirmed case counts in PR
                   over these two decades, we show that the pattern of
                   cyclic epidemics is strongly correlated with coalescent
                   estimates of effective population size that have been
                   estimated from sampled virus sequences using Bayesian
                   Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Thus, we show that
                   the observed epidemiologic dynamics are correlated with
                   similar fluctuations in diversity, including severe
                   interepidemic reductions in genetic diversity
                   compatible with population bottlenecks that may greatly
                   impact DENV evolutionary dynamics. Mean effective
                   population sizes based on genetic data appear to
                   increase prior to isolation counts, suggesting a
                   potential bias in the latter and justifying more active
                   surveillance of DENV activity. Our analysis explicitly
                   integrates epidemiologic and sequence data in a joint
                   model that could be used to further explore
                   transmission models of infectious disease.},

                   between genomes by means other than parent-to-offspring
                   inheritance. Although the transfer of genes is thought
                   to be crucial in prokaryotic evolution, few instances
                   of horizontal gene transfer have been reported in
                   multicellular eukaryotes; instead, most cases involve
                   transposable elements. With over 200 cases now
                   documented, it is possible to assess the importance of
                   horizontal transfer for the evolution of transposable
                   elements and their host genomes. We review criteria for
                   detecting horizontal transfers and examine recent
                   examples of the phenomenon, shedding light on its
                   mechanistic underpinnings, including the role of
                   host-parasite interactions. We argue that the
                   introduction of transposable elements by horizontal
                   transfer in eukaryotic genomes has been a major force
                   propelling genomic variation and biological innovation.},

                   than 50 years ago, but were totally ignored for a long
                   time. Over the last few decades they have gradually
                   attracted increasing interest from research scientists.
                   Initially they were viewed as totally marginal and
                   anecdotic, but TEs have been revealed as potentially
                   harmful parasitic entities, ubiquitous in genomes, and
                   finally as unavoidable actors in the diversity,
                   structure, and evolution of the genome. Since Darwin's
                   theory of evolution, and the progress of molecular
                   biology, transposable elements may be the discovery
                   that has most influenced our vision of (genome)
                   evolution. In this review, we provide a synopsis of
                   what is known about the complex interactions that exist
                   between transposable elements and the host genome.
                   Numerous examples of these interactions are provided,
                   first from the standpoint of the genome, and then from
                   that of the transposable elements. We also explore the
                   evolutionary aspects of TEs in the light of
                   post-Darwinian theories of evolution. REVIEWERS: This

                   elements, and their analysis is a vital part of
                   understanding the human genome as a whole. Many of
                   these elements are ancient and have persisted in the
                   genome for tens or hundreds of millions of years,
                   providing a window into the evolution of modern
                   mammals. The Golem family have been used as model
                   transposons to highlight computational analyses which
                   can be used to investigate these elements, particularly
                   the use of molecular dating with large transposon
                   families. Whole-genome searches found Golem sequences
                   in 20 mammalian species. Golem A and B subsequences
                   were only found in primates and squirrel.
                   Interestingly, the full-length Golem, found as a few
                   copies in many mammalian genomes, was found abundantly
                   in horse. A phylogenetic profile suggested that Golem
                   originated after the eutherian-metatherian divergence
                   and that the A and B subfamilies originated at a much
                   later date. Molecular dating based on sequence
                   diversity suggests an early age, of 175 Mya, for the
                   origin of the family and that the A and B lineages
                   originated much earlier than expected from their
                   current taxonomic distribution and have subsequently
                   been lost in some lineages. Using publically available
                   data, it is possible to investigate the evolutionary
                   history of transposon families. Determining in which
                   organisms a transposon can be found is often used to
                   date the origin and expansion of the families. However,
                   in this analysis, molecular dating, commonly used for
                   determining the age of gene sequences, has been used,
                   reducing the likelihood of errors from deleted
                   lineages.},

                   repeats (LTR TEs) are one of the best studied groups of
                   mobile elements. They are ubiquitous elements present
                   in almost all eukaryotic genomes. Their number and
                   state of conservation can be a highlight of genome
                   dynamics. We searched all published fungal genomes for
                   LTR-containing retrotransposons, including both
                   complete, functional elements and remnant copies. We
                   identified a total of over 66,000 elements, all of
                   which belong to the Ty1/Copia or Ty3/Gypsy
                   superfamilies. Most of the detected Gypsy elements
                   represent Chromoviridae, i.e. they carry a chromodomain
                   in the pol ORF. We analyzed our data from a
                   genome-ecology perspective, looking at the abundance of
                   various types of LTR TEs in individual genomes and at
                   the highest-copy element from each genome. The TE
                   content is very variable among the analyzed genomes.
                   Some genomes are very scarce in LTR TEs (<50 elements),
                   others demonstrate huge expansions (>8000 elements).
                   The data shows that transposon expansions in fungi
                   usually involve an increase both in the copy number of
                   individual elements and in the number of element types.
                   The majority of the highest-copy TEs from all genomes
                   are Ty3/Gypsy transposons. Phylogenetic analysis of
                   these elements suggests that TE expansions have
                   appeared independently of each other, in distant
                   genomes and at different taxonomical levels. We also
                   analyzed the evolutionary relationships between protein
                   domains encoded by the transposon pol ORF and we found
                   that the protease is the fastest evolving domain
                   whereas reverse transcriptase and RNase H evolve much
                   slower and in correlation with each other.},

  abstract       = {Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile, repetitive DNA
                   sequences that are almost ubiquitous in prokaryotic and
                   eukaryotic genomes. They have a large impact on genome
                   structure, function and evolution. With the recent
                   development of high-throughput sequencing methods, many
                   genome sequences have become available, making possible
                   comparative studies of TE dynamics at an unprecedented
                   scale. Several methods have been proposed for the de
                   novo identification of TEs in sequenced genomes. Most
                   begin with the detection of genomic repeats, but the
                   subsequent steps for defining TE families differ.
                   High-quality TE annotations are available for the
                   Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana genome
                   sequences, providing a solid basis for the benchmarking
                   of such methods. We compared the performance of
                   specific algorithms for the clustering of interspersed
                   repeats and found that only a particular combination of
                   algorithms detected TE families with good recovery of
                   the reference sequences. We then applied a new
                   procedure for reconciling the different clustering
                   results and classifying TE sequences. The whole
                   approach was implemented in a pipeline using the REPET
                   package. Finally, we show that our combined approach
                   highlights the dynamics of well defined TE families by
                   making it possible to identify structural variations
                   among their copies. This approach makes it possible to
                   annotate TE families and to study their diversification
                   in a single analysis, improving our understanding of TE
                   dynamics at the whole-genome scale and for diverse
                   species.},

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA
                   sequences, present in the genome of most eukaryotic
                   organisms that hold the key characteristic of being
                   able to mobilize and increase their copy number within
                   chromosomes. These elements are important for
                   eukaryotic genome structure and evolution and lately
                   have been considered as potential drivers for
                   introducing transgenes into pathogen-transmitting
                   insects as a means to control vector-borne diseases.
                   The aim of this work was to catalog the diversity and
                   abundance of TEs within the Anopheles gambiae genome
                   using the PILER tool and to consolidate a database in
                   the form of a hyperlinked spreadsheet containing
                   detailed and readily available information about the
                   TEs present in the genome of An. gambiae. RESULTS: Here
                   we present the spreadsheet named AnoTExcel that
                   constitutes a database with detailed information on
                   most of the repetitive elements present in the genome
                   of the mosquito. Despite previous work on this topic,
                   our approach permitted the identification and
                   characterization both of previously described and novel
                   TEs that are further described in detailed.
                   CONCLUSIONS: Identification and characterization of TEs
                   in a given genome is important as a way to understand
                   the diversity and evolution of the whole set of TEs
                   present in a given species. This work contributes to a
                   better understanding of the landscape of TEs present in
                   the mosquito genome. It also presents a novel platform
                   for the identification, analysis, and characterization
                   of TEs on sequenced genomes.},

  abstract       = {Ernst Mayr said that one of Darwin's greatest
                   contributions was to show scholars the way to
                   population thinking, and to help them discard a mindset
                   of typological thinking. Population thinking rejects a
                   focus on a central representative type, and emphasizes
                   the variation among individuals. However, Mayr's choice
                   of terms has led to confusion, particularly among
                   biologists who study natural populations. Both
                   population thinking and the concept of a biological
                   population were inspired by Darwin, and from Darwin the
                   chain for both concepts runs through Francis Galton who
                   introduced the statistical usage of "population" that
                   appears in Mayr's population thinking. It was Galton's
                   "population" that was modified by geneticists and
                   biometricians in the early 20th century to refer to an
                   interbreeding and evolving community of organisms.
                   Under this meaning, a population is a biological entity
                   and so paradoxically population thinking, which
                   emphasizes variation at the expense of dwelling on
                   entities, is usually not about populations. Mayr did
                   not address the potential for misunderstanding but for
                   him the important part of the population concept was
                   that the organisms within a population were variable,
                   and so he probably thought there should not be
                   confusion between population thinking and the concept
                   of a population.},

                   play fundamental roles in genome evolution. They can
                   also acquire new functions in the host organism and
                   some have been developed as incisive genetic tools for
                   transformation and mutagenesis. The hAT transposon
                   superfamily contains members from the plant and animal
                   kingdoms, some of which are active when introduced into
                   new host organisms. We have identified two new active
                   hAT transposons, AeBuster1, from the mosquito Aedes
                   aegypti and TcBuster from the red flour beetle
                   Tribolium castaneum. Activity of both transposons is
                   illustrated by excision and transposition assays
                   performed in Drosophila melanogaster and Ae. aegypti
                   and by in vitro strand transfer assays. These two
                   active insect transposons are more closely related to
                   the Buster sequences identified in humans than they are
                   to the previously identified active hAT transposons,
                   Ac, Tam3, Tol2, hobo, and Hermes. We therefore
                   reexamined the structural and functional relationships
                   of hAT and hAT-like transposase sequences extracted
                   from genome databases and found that the hAT
                   superfamily is divided into at least two families. This
                   division is supported by a difference in target-site
                   selections generated by active transposons of each
                   family. We name these families the Ac and Buster
                   families after the first identified transposon or
                   transposon-like sequence in each. We find that the
                   recently discovered SPIN transposons of mammals are
                   located within the family of Buster elements.},

                   integrate the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of
                   rapidly evolving populations like those of RNA viruses
                   - increasingly relies upon coalescent approaches to
                   infer past population dynamics from reconstructed
                   genealogies. As sequence data have become more
                   abundant, these approaches are beginning to be used on
                   populations undergoing rapid and rather complex
                   dynamics. In such cases, the simple demographic models
                   that current phylodynamic methods employ can be
                   limiting. First, these models are not ideal for
                   yielding biological insight into the processes that
                   drive the dynamics of the populations of interest.
                   Second, these models differ in form from mechanistic
                   and often stochastic population dynamic models that are
                   currently widely used when fitting models to time
                   series data. As such, their use does not allow for both
                   genealogical data and time series data to be considered
                   in tandem when conducting inference. Here, we present a
                   flexible statistical framework for phylodynamic
                   inference that goes beyond these current limitations.
                   The framework we present employs a recently developed
                   method known as particle MCMC to fit stochastic,
                   nonlinear mechanistic models for complex population
                   dynamics to gene genealogies and time series data in a
                   Bayesian framework. We demonstrate our approach using a
                   nonlinear Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model
                   for the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease
                   and show through simulations that it provides accurate
                   estimates of past disease dynamics and key
                   epidemiological parameters from genealogies with or

  abstract       = {Horizontal transfer of genetic material between
                   complex organisms often involves transposable elements
                   (TEs). For example, a DNA transposon mariner has been
                   shown to undergo horizontal transfer between different
                   orders of insects and between different phyla of
                   animals. Here we report the discovery and
                   characterization of an ITmD37D transposon, MJ1, in
                   Anopheles sinensis. We show that some MJ1 elements in
                   Aedes aegypti and An. sinensis contain intact open
                   reading frames and share nearly 99\% nucleotide
                   identity over the entire transposon, which is
                   unexpectedly high given that these two genera had
                   diverged 145-200 million years ago. Chromosomal
                   hybridization and TE-display showed that MJ1 copy
                   number is low in An. sinensis. Among 24 mosquito
                   species surveyed, MJ1 is only found in Ae. aegypti and
                   the hyrcanus group of anopheline mosquitoes to which
                   An. sinensis belongs. Phylogenetic analysis is
                   consistent with horizontal transfer and provides the
                   basis for inference of its timing and direction.
                   Although report of horizontal transfer of DNA
                   transposons between higher eukaryotes is accumulating,
                   our analysis is one of a small number of cases in which
                   horizontal transfer of nearly identical TEs among
                   highly divergent species has been thoroughly
                   investigated and strongly supported. Horizontal
                   transfer involving mosquitoes is of particular interest
                   because there are ongoing investigations of the
                   possibility of spreading pathogen-resistant genes into
                   mosquito populations to control malaria and other
                   infectious diseases. The initial indication of
                   horizontal transfer of MJ1 came from comparisons
                   between a 0.4x coverage An. sinensis 454 sequence
                   database and available TEs in mosquito genomes.
                   Therefore we have shown that it is feasible to use low
                   coverage sequencing to systematically uncover
                   horizontal transfer events. Expanding such efforts
                   across a wide range of species will generate novel
                   insights into the relative frequency of horizontal
                   transfer of different TEs and provide the evolutionary
                   context of these lateral transfer events.},

                   (SGEs), which enhance their own transmission relative

                   or harmful to the individual as a whole. As a result,
                   genetic conflict occurs between SGEs and other genetic
                   elements in the genome. There is growing evidence that
                   SGEs, and the resulting genetic conflict, are an
                   important motor for evolutionary change and innovation.
                   In this review, the kinds of SGEs and their
                   evolutionary consequences are described, including how
                   these elements shape basic biological features, such as
                   genome structure and gene regulation, evolution of new
                   genes, origin of new species, and mechanisms of sex

  abstract       = {The term 'phylodynamics' was coined in a 2004 Science
                   review authored by Grenfell and colleagues. In this
                   review, the aim of this field's research was clearly
                   articulated: to better understand how ecological,
                   evolutionary, and immunological processes shape viral
                   phylogenies. Since 2004, this field has grown
                   exponentially, with over 450 publications to date
                   contributing to its goals. A cursory overview of these
                   publications indicates that the field has grown in two
                   distinct directions, with little cross-talk between
                   them. The first direction has continued to focus on the
                   processes shaping viral phylogenies by implementing
                   mechanistic disease models and comparing their
                   simulated sequences or infection trees against
                   phylogenies reconstructed from empirical sequences. The
                   second direction, becoming ever more prominent, instead
                   starts with viral sequences and uses predominantly
                   coalescent approaches to reconstruct time-varying
                   infection dynamics. These reconstructed infection
                   dynamics can be compared against time series data, when
                   available, with the possibility of leading to
                   qualitative conclusions about when selective processes
                   might be at play. In May 2011, the RAPIDD program
                   funded a 5-day workshop focused on furthering the field
                   of phylodynamics. The goal of this workshop was to
                   bring together leading researchers using one or both of
                   the approaches outlined above in an attempt to more
                   effectively unify these directions. The focus was true
                   to the original aim of 'phylodynamics', and discussions
                   were therefore focused on whether processes could be
                   identified from the shapes of viral phylogenies and
                   novel statistical methods that would facilitate this
                   identification. This phylodynamic synthesis is a key
                   area in the Metadynamics Working Group. The workshop
                   was centered on participant talks, with daily
                   discussions that aimed to integrate across these talks
                   to provide a constructive way forward for the field.
                   The workshop was highly productive: from a combination
                   of the talks and discussions that the workshop
                   facilitated, several collaborative interactions emerged
                   and a synthesis paper was outlined to revisit the
                   maturation of the field of phylodynamics. A subset of
                   these collaborative interactions would greatly benefit
                   from one or two additional meetings. These would be
                   small working meetings instead of workshops and consist
                   of 3-6 individuals. },

                   challenge to both human and economic development in
                   malaria endemic countries. The impact of malaria can be
                   categorized from three dimensions, namely: health,
                   social and economic. The objective of this study was to
                   estimate the impact of malaria morbidity on gross
                   domestic product (GDP) of Uganda. METHODS: The impact
                   of malaria morbidity on GDP of Uganda was estimated
                   using double-log econometric model. The 1997-2003 time
                   series macro-data used in the analysis were for 28
                   quarters, i.e. 7 years times 4 quarters per year. It
                   was obtained from national and international secondary
                   sources. RESULTS: The slope coefficient for Malaria
                   Index (M) was 0.00767; which indicates that when
                   malaria morbidity increases by one unit, while holding
                   all other explanatory variables constant, per capita
                   GDP decreases by US\$0.00767 per year. In 2003 Uganda
                   lost US\$ 49,825,003 of GDP due to malaria morbidity.
                   Dividing the total loss of US\$49.8 million by a
                   population of 25,827,000 yields a loss in GDP of
                   US\$1.93 per person in Uganda in 2003. CONCLUSION:
                   Malaria morbidity results in a substantive loss in GDP
                   of Uganda. The high burden of malaria leads to
                   decreased long-term economic growth, and works against
                   poverty eradication efforts and socioeconomic
                   development of the country.},

  Note           = {Draft to be submitted to the Bioinformatics Journal},
  abstract       = {MOTIVATION: Transposable Elements (TEs) are small
                   genomic elements present in almost all genomes
                   sequenced so far, that appear repeatedly in the
                   individuals genome. Much debate is ongoing about their
                   origin, but some mechanisms for the invasion of a host
                   individual and the later spread within a host
                   population are known from both in silico and wet
                   laboratory experiments. In order to take into account
                   the forces that promote variation in TEs, three
                   independent levels of biological organization must be
                   evaluated simultaneously: (a) the population
                   demographics should be represented by a proper
                   ecological model, (b) the TEs' population genetics
                   should be given by a proper transposition model and (c)
                   the TE sequences must evolve according to a known
                   evolutionary model. Previous efforts in modelling TE
                   dynamics focused mostly on the net quantity of TEs,
                   either per individual or in the whole population.
                   RESULTS: We present TRepid, an individual-based model
                   that can be used to simulate TE invasion and fixation
                   on an age-structured host population. Population
                   dynamics features include random mating, selectable
                   ecological models (including constant population,
                   linear and exponential growth or decay and logistic)
                   and recombination by crossing over of gametes. The TEs
                   dynamics featuresinclude: transposition by copy and
                   paste or cut and paste, models that determine
                   transposition rate, nucleotide substitution according
                   to a selectable molecular evolutionary model, active
                   and inactive TEs, inactivation of TE over generations,
                   selective pressure on host individuals by accumulation
                   of TEs and deleterious transposition events, among

                   phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo
                   (MCMC) methods. With this note, we announce the release
                   of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official
                   release presented in 2003. The new version provides
                   convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to
                   be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored
                   on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and
                   automatic optimization of tuning parameters has
                   improved convergence for many problems. The new version
                   also sports significantly faster likelihood
                   calculations through streaming
                   single-instruction-multiple-data extensions (SSE) and
                   support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood
                   calculations to be delegated to graphics processing
                   units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors
                   range from around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with
                   BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all
                   models allows long runs to be completed even when an
                   analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include
                   relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across
                   time-reversible substitution models, and support for
                   hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree
                   constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees
                   is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian
                   estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal
                   model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be
                   estimated accurately across the entire model space
                   using the stepping stone method. The new version
                   provides more output options than previously, including
                   samples of ancestral states, site rates, site d(N)/d(S)
                   rations, branch rates, and node dates. A wide range of
                   statistics on tree parameters can also be output for

                   the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees
                   (BEAST) software package version 1.7, which implements
                   a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms
                   for Bayesian phylogenetic inference, divergence time
                   dating, coalescent analysis, phylogeography and related
                   molecular evolutionary analyses. This package includes
                   an enhanced graphical user-interface program called
                   Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility (BEAUti) that
                   enables access to advanced models for molecular
                   sequence and phenotypic trait evolution that were
                   previously available to developers only. The package

                   understanding of most aspects of the origin and
                   evolution of life, and in recent years, there has been
                   a concentration of interest in statistical approaches
                   such as Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood
                   estimation. Yet, for large data sets and realistic or
                   interesting models of evolution, these approaches
                   remain computationally demanding. High-throughput
                   sequencing can yield data for thousands of taxa, but
                   scaling to such problems using serial computing often
                   necessitates the use of nonstatistical or approximate
                   approaches. The recent emergence of graphics processing
                   units (GPUs) provides an opportunity to leverage their
                   excellent floating-point computational performance to
                   accelerate statistical phylogenetic inference. A
                   specialized library for phylogenetic calculation would
                   allow existing software packages to make more effective
                   use of available computer hardware, including GPUs.
                   Adoption of a common library would also make it easier
                   for other emerging computing architectures, such as
                   field programmable gate arrays, to be used in the
                   future. We present BEAGLE, an application programming
                   interface (API) and library for high-performance
                   statistical phylogenetic inference. The API provides a
                   uniform interface for performing phylogenetic
                   likelihood calculations on a variety of compute
                   hardware platforms. The library includes a set of
                   efficient implementations and can currently exploit
                   hardware including GPUs using NVIDIA CUDA, central
                   processing units (CPUs) with Streaming SIMD Extensions
                   and related processor supplementary instruction sets,
                   and multicore CPUs via OpenMP. To demonstrate the
                   advantages of a common API, we have incorporated the
                   library into several popular phylogenetic software
                   packages. The BEAGLE library is free open source
                   software licensed under the Lesser GPL and available

  abstract       = {Changes in Dengue virus (DENV) disease patterns in the
                   Americas over recent decades have been attributed, at
                   least in part, to repeated introduction of DENV strains
                   from other regions, resulting in a shift from
                   hypoendemicity to hyperendemicity. Using newly
                   sequenced DENV-1 and DENV-3 envelope (E) gene isolates
                   from 11 Caribbean countries, along with sequences
                   available on GenBank, we sought to document the
                   population genetic and spatiotemporal transmission
                   histories of the four main invading DENV genotypes
                   within the Americas and investigate factors that
                   influence the rate and intensity of DENV transmission.
                   For all genotypes, there was an initial invasion phase
                   characterized by rapid increases in genetic diversity,
                   which coincided with the first confirmed cases of each
                   genotype in the region. Rapid geographic dispersal
                   occurred upon each genotype's introduction, after which
                   individual lineages were locally maintained, and gene
                   flow was primarily observed among neighboring and
                   nearby countries. There were, however, centers of viral
                   diversity (Barbados, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Suriname,
                   Venezuela, and Brazil) that were repeatedly involved in
                   gene flow with more distant locations. For DENV-1 and
                   DENV-2, we found that a "distance-informed" model,
                   which posits that the intensity of virus movement
                   between locations is inversely proportional to the
                   distance between them, provided a better fit than a
                   model assuming equal rates of movement between all
                   pairs of countries. However, for DENV-3 and DENV-4, the
                   more stochastic "equal rates" model was preferred.},

                   (CRDH) with the technical assistance of ICF Macro and
                   the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) conducted
                   in 2008/2009 the Senegal Malaria Indicator Survey
                   (SMIS), the first nationally representative household
                   survey collecting parasitological data and
                   malaria-related indicators. In this paper, we present
                   spatially explicit parasitaemia risk estimates and
                   number of infected children below 5 years.
                   Geostatistical Zero-Inflated Binomial models (ZIB) were
                   developed to take into account the large number of
                   zero-prevalence survey locations (70\%) in the data.
                   Bayesian variable selection methods were incorporated
                   within a geostatistical framework in order to choose
                   the best set of environmental and climatic covariates
                   associated with the parasitaemia risk. Model validation
                   confirmed that the ZIB model had a better predictive
                   ability than the standard Binomial analogue. Markov
                   chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used for
                   inference. Several insecticide treated nets (ITN)
                   coverage indicators were calculated to assess the
                   effectiveness of interventions. After adjusting for
                   climatic and socio-economic factors, the presence of at
                   least one ITN per every two household members and
                   living in urban areas reduced the odds of parasitaemia
                   by 86\% and 81\% respectively. Posterior estimates of
                   the ORs related to the wealth index show a decreasing
                   trend with the quintiles. Infection odds appear to be
                   increasing with age. The population-adjusted prevalence
                   ranges from 0.12\% in Thille-Boubacar to 13.1\% in
                   Dabo. Tambacounda has the highest population-adjusted
                   predicted prevalence (8.08\%) whereas the region with
                   the highest estimated number of infected children under
                   the age of 5 years is Kolda (13940). The contemporary
                   map and estimates of malaria burden identify the
                   priority areas for future control interventions and
                   provide baseline information for monitoring and
                   evaluation. Zero-Inflated formulations are more
                   appropriate in modeling sparse geostatistical survey
                   data, expected to arise more frequently as malaria
                   research is focused on elimination.},

                   transposable elements?},

  abstract       = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Many theoretical models
                   predicting the dynamics of transposable elements (TEs)
                   in genomes, populations, and species have already been
                   proposed. However, most of them only focus on
                   populations of sexual diploid individuals, and TE
                   dynamics in populations partly composed by autogamous
                   individuals remains poorly investigated. To estimate
                   the impact of selfing on TE dynamics, the short- and
                   long-term evolution of TEs was simulated in outcrossing
                   populations with various proportions of selfing
                   individuals. RESULTS: Selfing has a deep impact on TE
                   dynamics: the higher the selfing rate, the lower the
                   probability of invasion. Already known non-equilibrium
                   dynamics (complete loss, domestication, cyclical
                   invasion of TEs) can all be described whatever the
                   mating system. However, their pattern and their
                   respective frequencies greatly depend on the selfing
                   rate. For instance, in cyclical dynamics resulting from
                   interactions between autonomous and non-autonomous
                   copies, cycles are faster when the selfing rate
                   increases. Interestingly, an abrupt change in the
                   mating system from sexuality to complete asexuality
                   leads to the loss of all the elements over a few
                   hundred generations. In general, for intermediate
                   selfing rates, the transposition activity remains
                   maintained. CONCLUSIONS: Our theoretical results
                   evidence that a clear and systematic contrast in TE
                   content according to the mating system is expected,
                   with a smooth transition for intermediate selfing
                   rates. Several parameters impact the TE copy number,
                   and all dynamics described in allogamous populations
                   can be also observed in partly autogamous species. This
                   study thus provides new insights to understand the
                   complex signal from empirical comparison of closely
                   related species with different mating systems.},

                   invasion process taking into consideration the inherent
                   evolution that occurs within several generations, and
                   use phylodynamics techniques to reconstruct the
                   backwards process. Although we use techniques developed
                   for virus sequence data against TE sequence data, we
                   argue that to do so some analogies must be made, but
                   reasonable ones. We justify each such analogy made.},
